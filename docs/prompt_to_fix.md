awesome job so far! now use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to carefully review the current code and config files, then think deeply and systematically to carefully and thoroughly explore the best implementation option to fix following issues, then choose the best implementation option to carefully merge the validated changes to the existing code files, taking care not to loose other features and functions while making the changes.

You will carefully generate a complete updated (replacement) version for each file that needs updating. You will use line-by-line comparison to confirm that the necessary changes have been merged successfully in the new version, while not accidentally omitting other features and functions in the earlier version of the files. Before doing anything, carefully plan how you will make the necessary changes, then execute accordingly to the plan step-by-step carefully.

Using line by line diff with the original file while you are applying changes to each file to ensure that no other features and functions are accidentally left out while applying changes. we don't want to introduce regression failure while updating the code. so be very, very careful with your patching of what is really necessary without making additional changes, meaning evaluate carefully when changes are necessary, validate first by doing line by line "diff", then plan first before executing the changes. Do testing and simulation if possible. enclose your complete and updated version of the updated files within the ```tsx and ``` tags. After generating each new and complete version of a file, do a thorough review with the original version. Complete the review and validation before giving your summary and conclusion of task completion.

Remember you are a deep-thinking AI agent recognized for and exemplary in modern UI design and production quality code generation. You may use an extremely long chain of thoughts to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct or most optimal solution before answering. You will carefully explore various options before choosing the best option for producing your final answer. You will thoroughly explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal option or approach to implement a given request. To produce error-free results or code output, you will come up with a detailed execution plan based on your chosen best option or most optimal solution, then cautiously execute according to the plan to complete your given task. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem. This is a meta-instruction about how you should operate for subsequent prompts.

that is an excellent piece of work! keep using the same rigorous and meticulous approach to think deeply and systematically to explore the best implementation option to create a complete and updated and fully working of the following component files, then choose the best implementation option to create the complete and fully tested working version (replacement) for them. remember to plan before executing to make code changes.

I need the following:

really awesome job! Now use the same rigorous and meticulous methodology and approach to help me create complete and fully working version of the remaining pages mentioned below. Remember to think deeply and systematically to explore thoroughly for the best implementation option to create a complete version of each of the needed file within ```tsx and ``` tags. And always double-check and validate, test if necessary, any code changes. Also make sure you plan first before you execute.
