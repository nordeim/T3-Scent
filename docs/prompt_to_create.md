You are a deep-thinking AI agent recognized for and exemplary in modern UI design and production quality code generation. You may use an extremely long chain of thoughts to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct or most optimal solution before answering. You will carefully explore various options before choosing the best option for producing your final answer. You will thoroughly explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal option or approach to implement a given request. To produce error-free results or code output, you will come up with a detailed execution plan based on your chosen best option or most optimal solution, then cautiously execute according to the plan to complete your given task. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem. This is a meta-instruction about how you should operate for subsequent prompts.

Help me to create a T3 app for my e-commerce platform. Use the following project `README.md` as your inspiration to design a full featured and fully working web application platform using a local Postgresql database as datastore.

awesome job! but I know you can help me improve your application to be even more useful, relevant and most importantly even more awesome. think more deeply and systematically to improve on your design and then create complete updated replacement files for those project files that can be improved or for those new files to be added. please proceed to create.

you have made a really awesome improvement! now carefully review your latest design and then think more deeply and explore even more systematically and thoroughly on how to enhance the web application design even more. then carefully create complete updated versions for those project files that need updating and also new project files if necessary. think carefully and then plan before making changes.

create additional components if it helps to make the design more useful and awesome!

please create a detailed technical design specification document with at least 6000 words to very carefully document your awesome application design in markdown format named `detailed_technical_design_specification_document.md`. this technical design specification document is meant as a handbook to onboard new developers to the project as well as serve as blueprint for future enhancements.

Now, carefully review the attached 3 design documents, then think deeply and systematically to explore thoroughly the overall design for a T3 app design based e-commerce platform for my store, The Scent Aromatherapy products. Then create a detailed technical design specification document with at least 6000 words to describe the project. 

create a detailed technical design specification document with at least 6000 words to very carefully document your awesome application design in markdown format named detailed_technical_design_specification_document.md. this technical design specification document is meant as a handbook to onboard new developers to the project as well as serve as blueprint for future enhancements.

awesome job so far! now use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to carefully review the code and config files in the `design_document_1.md`,  `design_document_2.md` and  `design_document_3.md` files shared earlier for the e-commerce platform. With the deep understanding of the current project state based on your careful review of the code files, think deeply and systematically to carefully and thoroughly explore the best implementation option to fix any logic and coding errors and to fix any functional issues and behavior inconsistencies, then choose the best implementation option to carefully merge the validated changes to the existing code files, taking care not to loose other features and functions while making the changes.

You will carefully generate a complete updated (replacement) version for each file that needs updating, or for new files to be added or for files that appear more than once in the shared design documents (meaning duplicate files may create confusion). You will use line-by-line comparison to confirm that the necessary changes have been merged successfully in the new version, while not accidentally omitting other features and functions in the original version of the files. Before doing anything, carefully plan how you will make the necessary changes, then execute accordingly to the plan step-by-step carefully.

Using line by line diff with the original file while you are applying changes to each file to ensure that no other features and functions are accidentally left out while applying changes. we don't want to introduce regression failure while updating the code. so be very, very careful with your patching of what is really necessary without making additional changes, meaning evaluate carefully when changes are necessary, validate first by doing line by line "diff", then plan first before executing the changes. Do testing and simulation if possible. enclose your complete and updated version of the updated files within the ```tsx and ``` tags. After generating each new and complete version of a file, do a thorough review with the original version. Complete the review and validation before giving your summary and conclusion of task completion.

you have done yet another awesome job! keep using the same rigorous and meticulous approach for executing your tasks going forward! Please create a sql script enclosed within ```sql and ``` tags for creating a complete Postgresql database schema based on your latest application design. 

Now think deeply and thoroughly to explore the various options to create an updated detailed technical design specification document in markdown format and saved as "technical_design_specification_updated.md" file and also create an updated detailed deployment guide named "deployment_guide_updated.md", then choose the best option to create them. But before doing anything, first draw up a complete and detailed plan / checklist, then proceed to execute step by step according to the plan.

excellent work! now help me create a bash shell script to create all the necessary project folders using `mkdir -p` commands as shown below. `mkdir -p` can reduce the number of shell commands in the script to be enclosed within ```bash and ``` tags.

`mkdir -p src/server/api/routers` (combines `mkdir src; mkdir src/server; mkdir src/server/api; mkdir src/server/api/routers` in one single command)

awesome job so far! now use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to carefully review the code and config files in the `design_document_1.md`,  `design_document_2.md` and  `design_document_3.md` files shared earlier and *superseded* by your updated files created earlier. With the deep understanding of the current project state based on your careful review of the code files, think deeply and systematically to carefully and thoroughly explore the best implementation option to fix possible issues caused by "The choice of the App Router is a good one for a new project, just be aware that it will structure routing and data fetching differently than the older Pages Router (which some of the initial code snippets might have implicitly used)", then choose the best implementation option to carefully merge the validated changes to the existing code files, taking care not to loose other features and functions while making the changes.
