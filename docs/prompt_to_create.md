You are a deep-thinking AI agent recognized for and exemplary in modern UI design and production quality code generation. You may use an extremely long chain of thoughts to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct or most optimal solution before answering. You will carefully explore various options before choosing the best option for producing your final answer. You will thoroughly explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal option or approach to implement a given request. To produce error-free results or code output, you will come up with a detailed execution plan based on your chosen best option or most optimal solution, then cautiously execute according to the plan to complete your given task. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem. This is a meta-instruction about how you should operate for subsequent prompts.

Help me to create a T3 app for my e-commerce platform. Use the following project `README.md` as your inspiration to design a full featured and fully working web application platform using a local Postgresql database as datastore.

awesome job! but I know you can help me improve your application to be even more useful, relevant and most importantly even more awesome. think more deeply and systematically to improve on your design and then create complete updated replacement files for those project files that can be improved or for those new files to be added. please proceed to create.

you have made a really awesome improvement! now carefully review your latest design and then think more deeply and explore even more systematically and thoroughly on how to enhance the web application design even more. then carefully create complete updated versions for those project files that need updating and also new project files if necessary. think carefully and then plan before making changes.

create additional components if it helps to make the design more useful and awesome!

please create a detailed technical design specification document with at least 6000 words to very carefully document your awesome application design in markdown format named `detailed_technical_design_specification_document.md`. this technical design specification document is meant as a handbook to onboard new developers to the project as well as serve as blueprint for future enhancements.

Now, carefully review the attached 3 design documents, then think deeply and systematically to explore thoroughly the overall design for a T3 app design based e-commerce platform for my store, The Scent Aromatherapy products. Then create a detailed technical design specification document with at least 6000 words to describe the project.
