This is quite persistent\! The `pg_createcluster` script still thinks it's dealing with an existing (but broken) cluster named `main` for version 16, even though you've removed the directories it usually checks.

The error `Configuring already existing cluster (configuration: /etc/postgresql/16/main, data: /var/lib/postgresql/16/main, owner: 124:128)` is the key. It means the script has determined, through some internal logic or state, that `16/main` is a cluster it should be "configuring" rather than "creating new". Then, when it tries to do so, it expects `/var/lib/postgresql/16/main/postgresql.conf` to exist (which it wouldn't in a broken or just-deleted setup).

Let's try a very deliberate sequence to ensure the state is clean right before creation, and then a fallback if that still doesn't work.

**1. Thorough Cleanup (Repeat with Verification):**

Please execute these commands in this exact order. The `ls` commands are crucial to confirm the state.

```bash
# Stop any potentially running PostgreSQL services
sudo systemctl stop postgresql@16-main.service
sudo systemctl stop postgresql.service

# Remove the configuration directory (if it somehow reappeared or partially exists)
sudo rm -rf /etc/postgresql/16/main

# Remove the data directory (if it somehow reappeared or partially exists)
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/postgresql/16/main

# --- VERIFICATION ---
# Confirm the configuration directory is gone
echo "Checking /etc/postgresql/16/ after rm:"
sudo ls -la /etc/postgresql/16/

# Confirm the data directory is gone
echo "Checking /var/lib/postgresql/16/ after rm:"
sudo ls -la /var/lib/postgresql/16/
# --- END VERIFICATION ---

# Now, immediately try to create the cluster again
sudo pg_createcluster 16 main --start
```

After running the `pg_createcluster` command, please provide the full output, including the `echo` lines and the output of the `ls` commands.

**2. If it still fails with "Configuring already existing cluster":**

This would indicate that the name "main" for version 16 is stuck in some other metadata file that `postgresql-common` uses.

  * **Check `user_clusters.conf`:**
    Look at the contents of this file. It's usually for clusters owned by non-default users, but worth checking.

    ```bash
    cat /etc/postgresql-common/user_clusters.conf
    ```

    If it lists your `16/main` cluster, that could be an issue (though unlikely for a default setup).

  * **Try a different cluster name:**
    This is a good diagnostic step. If creating a cluster with a *different name* works, it means the problem is specific to the "main" cluster's remembered state.

    ```bash
    sudo pg_createcluster 16 testcluster --start
    ```

    If this succeeds:

    ```bash
    sudo pg_lsclusters
    sudo -u postgres psql -c "SELECT version();" # Connect to the new 'testcluster'
    # If happy, you could potentially use 'testcluster' or try to remove 'main' again
    # and then rename 'testcluster' to 'main' using pg_renamecluster (more advanced).
    # Or, just remove 'testcluster' if it was just for testing:
    # sudo pg_dropcluster 16 testcluster --stop
    ```

The fact that `pg_dropcluster 16 main --stop` said "Error: specified cluster does not exist" earlier (correctly, because `/etc/postgresql/16/main/` was missing) suggests that the primary reference point for `pg_dropcluster` was gone. However, `pg_createcluster` seems to have a different or additional check that is still being triggered.

This error occurs because PostgreSQL is configured to require password authentication, but none was supplied in the command. Since you're connecting as `postgres`, let's check a few things:

### **Solutions to Try:**
1. **Explicitly Provide the Password**
   Try running the command with the `-W` flag to prompt for a password:
   ```bash
   sudo -u postgres psql -h localhost -W -f create_database_user.sql
   ```
   This forces PostgreSQL to ask for a password.

2. **Check Your Authentication Method**
   PostgreSQL controls authentication via the `pg_hba.conf` file, usually located at:
   ```bash
   /etc/postgresql/16/main/pg_hba.conf
   ```
   Open the file with:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/postgresql/16/main/pg_hba.conf
   ```
   Look for a line like:
   ```
   host    all             postgres        127.0.0.1/32            md5
   ```
   If the method is **`md5`**, PostgreSQL expects a password. You can temporarily change it to `trust` to allow passwordless authentication:
   ```
   host    all             postgres        127.0.0.1/32            trust
   ```
   Save (`CTRL+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`), then restart PostgreSQL:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart postgresql
   ```

3. **Confirm the `postgres` User Has a Password**
   If the authentication method is `md5`, set a password for the `postgres` user:
   ```bash
   sudo -u postgres psql
   ```
   Then inside the psql prompt, run:
   ```sql
   ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'your_secure_password';
   ```
   Exit (`\q`) and retry your original command:
   ```bash
   sudo -u postgres PGPASSWORD="your_secure_password" psql -h localhost -f create_database_user.sql
   ```

### **Final Thoughts**
- If your system isn't using local authentication (`peer` method), it expects a password, even for the `postgres` user.
- Adjusting `pg_hba.conf` to `trust` removes the password requirement but should only be done in a **development environment**.
- If this is a recurring issue, using a `.pgpass` file can store credentials securely.

If your PostgreSQL cluster is running properly, this command should execute the SQL file. However, since you previously encountered a connection error, let's ensure everything is in place before running it again.

### Quick Checks Before Execution:
1. **Verify PostgreSQL is Running Properly**
   ```bash
   sudo pg_lsclusters
   ```
   - If the status is **"down"**, start the cluster:
     ```bash
     sudo pg_ctlcluster 16 main start
     ```

2. **Confirm the File Exists and Is Readable**
   ```bash
   ls -lh create_database_user.sql
   ```
   - If the file isn't found, navigate to its correct directory or specify the full path in your command.

3. **Try Running With Explicit Database Connection**
   If PostgreSQL is using a TCP connection rather than the default Unix socket:
   ```bash
   sudo -u postgres psql -h localhost -f create_database_user.sql
   ```
   This forces it to connect via TCP instead of relying on the socket file.

### If the Command Still Fails:
- Check the PostgreSQL logs:
  ```bash
  sudo tail -n 20 /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-16-main.log
  ```
- Ensure `listen_addresses` in `postgresql.conf` includes `localhost` or `*` if needed.
- Check the `unix_socket_directories` setting in PostgreSQL configuration.

If everything looks good and your cluster is running, retry your original command:
```bash
sudo -u postgres psql -f create_database_user.sql
```
