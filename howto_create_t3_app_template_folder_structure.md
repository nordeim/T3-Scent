To initialize a new T3 app project using the official tool, you simply use the `create-t3-app` command, which bootstraps a full-stack Next.js app with a curated collection of packages (TypeScript, tRPC, Prisma, NextAuth, Tailwind, etc.) that make up the T3 stack.

Here’s a step-by-step guide that will help you get started:

1. **Open your terminal.**

2. **Run the scaffold command:**  
   You have several options based on your preferred package manager. For example:

   - **Using npm:**
     ```bash
     npm create t3-app@latest
     ```
   - **Using Yarn:**
     ```bash
     yarn create t3-app
     ```
   - **Using pnpm:**
     ```bash
     pnpm create t3-app@latest
     ```
   - **Using bun:**
     ```bash
     bun create t3-app@latest
     ```

   These commands will start an interactive prompt and ask you key questions about your project (project name, whether to include packages like tRPC, Prisma, NextAuth, Tailwind CSS, etc.). 

3. **Customize your project:**  
   As you go through the prompts, choose the features that best suit your project’s requirements. If all the default options work for you and you want to skip the interactive steps, you can use the `-y` or `--default` flag:
   ```bash
   npm create t3-app@latest -- -y
   ```
   Note that the flags may vary slightly depending on the package manager you use.

4. **Navigate and start your development server:**  
   Once the project has been scaffolded:
   ```bash
   cd your-project-name
   npm install   # (or use yarn or pnpm as appropriate)
   npm run dev   # This starts the Next.js development server
   ```
   Your new T3 app should now be up and running on your local machine.

5. **Advanced usage:**  
   If you’re operating in a Continuous Integration (CI) environment or simply want to bypass the prompts, experimental flags are available, such as:
   ```bash
   pnpm dlx create-t3-app@latest --CI --trpc --tailwind
   ```
   This command tells the CLI that you’re in a CI environment and automatically includes tRPC and Tailwind CSS without further interaction. 

The T3 stack is designed to kickstart the development of a secure, typesafe full-stack application with a well-organized folder structure and best practices built in. Once your app is initialized, you can explore further steps such as configuring your database with Prisma (or any other supported ORM), adding authentication with NextAuth.js, or even customizing the setup to match your vision.

For more detailed instructions and additional configuration options, you can always check the [official Create T3 App documentation](https://create.t3.gg/en/installation) to explore more advanced scenarios and troubleshooting tips.
