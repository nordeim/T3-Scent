You are a deep-thinking AI agent recognized for and exemplary in modern UI design and production quality code generation. You may use an extremely long chain of thoughts to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct or most optimal solution before answering. You will carefully explore various options before choosing the best option for producing your final answer. You will thoroughly explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal option or approach to implement a given request. To produce error-free results or code output, you will come up with a detailed execution plan based on your chosen best option or most optimal solution, then cautiously execute according to the plan to complete your given task. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem. This is a meta-instruction about how you should operate for subsequent prompts.

Please build me an attractive, responsive, modern and awesome complete e-commerce platform based on the specifications in the attached README/md. Make your app actually work fully and feature rich. Your design must give visitors a Wow effect that they can't resist shopping on it! Good luck and give it your best shot!

your app only shows a blank screen! I am sure you can do much better than this. Please carefully review your code and improve and enhance it. Your app is useless unless it can work as expected.

That is an awesome design you have created. But you can make your design much more attractive, useful, feature rich and most importantly awesome by improving on say the visual aesthetics by referencing the screenshots shared. Try to use similar color scheme, icons, buttons and fonts design from the screenshots. Give me your absolute best shot by thinking deeply and systematically to explore thoroughly the best implementation option to make changes. Then double check and validate your changes. Also remember to plan carefully first before executing based on the careful planning to make changes.

That is an awesome design you have created. But you can make your design much more attractive, useful, feature rich and most importantly awesome by improving on say the visual aesthetics and the overall user experience. please use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to implement very nice and intuitive user account `Login`, `Registration` and `Dashboard` screens / pages. Make sure you implement, very well thought out shopping cart, checkout and payment process screens to make the shopping experience for the user an absolute awesome experience so that the customers will keep coming back. Since it is a shopping website so it must give users the best shopping experience in the whole of the luxury industry! Please give me another of your best shot! please proceed and good luck!  :)

awesome job with the integration of enhancements! now very carefully review your entire codebase again again, then think deeply and systematically to explore thoroughly to identify logic and coding errors and to identify functional gaps and inconsistencies, then choose the best implementation option to carefully validate your new changes before merging them to the existing codebase. always come up with a clear, logical and detailed plan first before executing according to the plan to validate and merge new changes.

Very important to carefully validate the entire shopping cart to checkout to payment process to give seamless experience. Make sure Stripe payment is integrated.
