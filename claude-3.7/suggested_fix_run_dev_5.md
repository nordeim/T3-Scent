The user is getting an error: `Error: \`headers\` was called outside a request scope.` This error is occurring in `src/trpc/server.ts` at the line `const heads = new Headers(headers());` within the `createContext` function.

**Error Analysis:**

*   **File:** `src/trpc/server.ts`
*   **Line:** `const heads = new Headers(headers());` (inside `createContext`)
*   **Problem:** The `headers()` function from `next/headers` is a dynamic function that can only be called during the rendering of a Server Component or within a Route Handler that is actively handling a request. It cannot be called at the top level of a module scope or during the module's initialization phase, which is what's happening here.
    *   My previous `src/trpc/server.ts` was:
        ```typescript
        // src/trpc/server.ts
        import "server-only";
        import { headers } from "next/headers"; // Imported at top level
        import { cache } from "react";
        import { appRouter } from "~/server/api/root";
        import { createInnerTRPCContext } from "~/server/api/trpc";
        import { auth } from "~/server/auth";

        const createContext = cache(async () => { // This function is cached
          const heads = new Headers(headers()); // headers() called when createContext is executed
          heads.set("x-trpc-source", "rsc");
          const session = await auth();
          return createInnerTRPCContext({
            session,
            headers: heads,
          });
        });

        // `createContext()` is awaited here, during module initialization if `api` is top-level
        const caller = appRouter.createCaller(await createContext());
        export { caller as api };
        ```
    *   The issue is `await createContext()` being called at the top level of the module when defining `caller`. This means `headers()` inside `createContext` is executed when the module `src/trpc/server.ts` is first imported and evaluated by Next.js, which might be outside of an active request scope for a specific page/component.

*   **Next.js Dynamic Functions Context:** Functions like `headers()`, `cookies()`, `draftMode()`, `useRouter()`, `useParams()`, `useSearchParams()` rely on being called within the specific context of a request (for server-side dynamic functions) or a React component render (for hooks).

**Solution Options:**

1.  **Delay `createContext` Execution:** Instead of creating the caller at the module's top level, create a function that *returns* a caller, and this function would then call `createContext` (and thus `headers()`) inside it. This ensures `headers()` is called only when the API client is actually used within a Server Component's render lifecycle.

    *   This is the standard pattern recommended by `create-t3-app` for the server-side tRPC client.

2.  **Pass `headers` to a factory function:** Create a factory function for the caller that accepts headers. Server Components would then call `headers()` themselves and pass it to this factory. This is more manual.

**Best Implementation Option:** Option 1. Refactor `src/trpc/server.ts` so that `api` is not a top-level initialized constant but rather a function or an object whose methods internally create the context and caller on demand, or `api` itself is a function that returns the caller.

The `create-t3-app` pattern typically exports `api` as an object created directly from `appRouter.createCaller`, where the context creation is designed to work correctly in Server Components. The key is *when* `createContext` (and thus `headers()`) is invoked.

Let's look at how `create-t3-app` typically handles this for `src/trpc/server.ts`:
It often looks like this:
```typescript
// Typical create-t3-app src/trpc/server.ts
import {
  createTRPCProxyClient,
  loggerLink,
  unstable_httpBatchStreamLink, // or httpBatchLink
} from "@trpc/client";
import { headers } from "next/headers";

import { type AppRouter } from "~/server/api/root";
import { transformer } from "./shared"; // Assuming superjson transformer

export const api = createTRPCProxyClient<AppRouter>({
  transformer,
  links: [
    loggerLink({
      enabled: (op) =>
        process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" ||
        (op.direction === "down" && op.result instanceof Error),
    }),
    unstable_httpBatchStreamLink({ // or httpBatchStreamLink
      url: getUrl(),
      headers() {
        const heads = new Map(headers()); // headers() is called here, within the link's header function
        heads.set("x-trpc-source", "rsc");
        return Object.fromEntries(heads);
      },
    }),
  ],
});
// getUrl() would be defined similar to getBaseUrl()
```
This pattern creates a proxy client. `headers()` is called within the `headers()` function of the link, which should be invoked per request when a tRPC call is made. This is for *making tRPC requests from the server to itself as if it were a client*, which is one way to use tRPC in Server Components.

However, the `appRouter.createCaller(context)` pattern is for *direct procedure calls* on the server, bypassing the HTTP layer. This is generally more performant for Server Component to server logic.

The previous `src/trpc/server.ts` was using `createCaller`. The problem is that `await createContext()` was at the top level.

**Refined Plan for `src/trpc/server.ts` using `createCaller`:**

The `createContext` itself should not be awaited at the module level. The `api` export should be structured such that the context is created (and thus `headers()` is called) only when a procedure is invoked.

A common pattern for `createCaller` in Server Components:
```typescript
// src/trpc/server.ts
import "server-only";
import { headers } from "next/headers";
import { cache } from "react"; // React cache for memoizing context per request

import { appRouter, type AppRouter } from "~/server/api/root";
import { createInnerTRPCContext } from "~/server/api/trpc";
import { auth } from "~/server/auth"; // Your NextAuth.js v5 auth function

/**
 * Creates a tRPC context for Server Components.
 * Uses React `cache` to ensure context is created once per request.
 */
const createServerContext = cache(async () => {
  const heads = new Headers(headers()); // Call headers() inside the cached function
  heads.set("x-trpc-source", "rsc-server-caller");
  const session = await auth(); // Get session for the current request
  return createInnerTRPCContext({
    session,
    headers: heads,
  });
});

// Export the API caller.
// When a Server Component imports and calls `api.procedure.query()`,
// `createServerContext()` will be invoked within that request's scope.
// The `await` happens when the caller is created before procedure execution.
export const api = appRouter.createCaller(await createServerContext());
```
Wait, the `await createServerContext()` is *still* at the top level here. This is the subtle part.
The `createCaller` itself needs to be done in a way that the context is fresh per request.

Let's look at the T3 Axioms for App Router tRPC context for server:
The T3 `Axioms` example for `src/trpc/server.ts` does this:
```typescript
// src/trpc/server.ts
import { cache } from "react";
import { headers } from "next/headers";

import { appRouter } from "~/server/api/root";
import { createTRPCContext as createTRPCContextInner } from "~/server/api/trpc"; // Assume this is createInnerTRPCContext

const createContext = cache(() => {
  const heads = new Headers(headers());
  heads.set("x-trpc-source", "rsc");

  return createTRPCContextInner({ // This should be createInnerTRPCContext taking {session, headers}
    headers: heads,
    session: {} as any, // Placeholder for session - THE SESSION MUST BE FETCHED HERE
  });
});
export const api = appRouter.createCaller(createContext()); // createContext() is called, its result is cached by `cache`
```
The crucial part is that `createContext()` (which calls `headers()`) is wrapped in `React.cache`. This means `headers()` will be called the first time `createContext()` is executed *within a given request-response lifecycle*. Subsequent calls to `api.procedure.query()` within the same server render pass will reuse the cached context.

My `createServerContext` already used `cache`. The problem is that `appRouter.createCaller(await createServerContext())` will execute `await createServerContext()` at module load time *once*. This is incorrect.

The caller itself should be created within the request scope, or the context it uses should be dynamically provided.

**Corrected `create-t3-app` inspired pattern for `src/trpc/server.ts`:**
The `api` object needs to be a proxy or a lazy-loaded caller.
`create-t3-app` often provides a `TRPCClientError` and a `serverClient` that looks like this:
```typescript
// Example from a create-t3-app scaffold
// src/trpc/server.ts
// import { createTRPCClient, httpBatchLink } from "@trpc/client";
// import { appRouter } from "~/server/api/root";
// import { getUrl, transformer } from "./shared";

// export const api = createTRPCClient<AppRouter>({
//   transformer,
//   links: [
//     httpBatchLink({
//       url: getUrl(),
//       headers() {
//         const h = new Headers();
//         h.set("x-trpc-source", "rsc");
//         return h;
//       },
//     }),
//   ],
// });
```
This pattern above (using `createTRPCClient`) makes actual HTTP requests from server to server, which is less direct than `createCaller`. `createCaller` is preferred for Server Components calling their own backend.

The issue is making `createCaller` work correctly with dynamic context (like `headers()` and `auth()`).

**The Real Fix for `createCaller` with Dynamic Context:**
The context creation needs to happen *when the caller is used*. The `createCaller` function takes a *function that returns the context* or the context itself. If it takes a function, it can call that function per request.

If `appRouter.createCaller` can take a function that *returns a promise of a context*:
```typescript
// src/trpc/server.ts
import "server-only";
import { headers } from "next/headers";
import { cache } from "react";

import { appRouter } from "~/server/api/root";
import { createInnerTRPCContext } from "~/server/api/trpc"; // This is the one taking {session, headers}
import { auth } from "~/server/auth";

const createRequestContext = async () => {
  const heads = new Headers(headers());
  heads.set("x-trpc-source", "rsc-caller");
  const session = await auth(); // auth() itself should be request-scoped or use AsyncLocalStorage
  return createInnerTRPCContext({
    session,
    headers: heads,
  });
};

// Create a caller that will generate context on each call (or per request if context is cached)
// This is not how createCaller typically works. It expects the context object.
// export const api = appRouter.createCaller(await createRequestContext()); // THIS IS THE PROBLEM - await at top level

// The context itself that is passed to createCaller must be the one resolved per request.
// `cache` from `react` helps here for a single request render tree.
const getRequestContext = cache(createRequestContext); // Cache the async context creation function's result per request

// Now, how to pass this to createCaller in a way that it's evaluated per request?
// createCaller normally takes the actual context object.

// Option A: Re-create caller per request (not ideal for an exported `api` object)
// async function getApiForRequest() {
//   const ctx = await getRequestContext();
//   return appRouter.createCaller(ctx);
// }

// Option B: Standard T3 pattern for server client using a proxy to defer context creation.
// This is often done by `experimental_createTRPCNextAppDirServer` or similar helpers if available.
// If not, a manual proxy might be needed, or we ensure `createContext` passed to `createCaller`
// is correctly request-scoped by React `cache`.

Let's re-check the T3 docs or a fresh scaffold for App Router `server.ts`.
The official T3 docs for App Router `src/trpc/server.ts` (as of my knowledge cutoff) often shows a direct caller pattern, assuming `createContext` (wrapped with `React.cache`) correctly provides request-scoped context.

The `cache` function from `react` is key:
`const cachedCreateContext = cache(createContext)`
When `cachedCreateContext()` is called, `cache` ensures `createContext` runs once per request during a render pass.
So, `appRouter.createCaller(cachedCreateContext())` *should* work if `cachedCreateContext()` is invoked inside a server component render or similar request-bound scope.

The issue is that `export const api = appRouter.createCaller(await getRequestContext());` executes `await getRequestContext()` *at module load time*.

The `create-t3-app` scaffold usually generates `src/trpc/server.ts` which does *not* `await` the context at the top level.
It often looks like:
```typescript
// src/trpc/server.ts
import { appRouter } from "~/server/api/root";
import { createTRPCContext } // The one that calls auth() and headers()
  from "~/server/api/trpc"; // This context creator needs to be async

/**
 * This is the server-side caller for tRPC.
 * It's important that this is NOT a React hook.
 * @example const data = await api.post.getAll();
 */
// This direct invocation of createTRPCContext is also problematic if it calls headers()
// export const api = appRouter.createCaller(await createTRPCContext({ TODO: how to pass req/headers here from RSC? }));

// A more robust pattern for server components using createCaller:
// Defer the creation of the caller or the context it uses.
// The caller itself needs to be created with a context that's specific to the current request.

// Let's try to make the context creation fully lazy within the caller.
// This involves more advanced tRPC usage or a helper.
// The simplest way is to create the caller inside the Server Component, but that's not reusable.

// If `auth()` and `headers()` are using AsyncLocalStorage correctly (which Next.js dynamic functions do),
// then `createInnerTRPCContext` can call them safely when invoked.
// `createTRPCContext` in `trpc.ts` calls `auth()`.

// The issue might be the structure of `createCaller(await createContext())`.
// `createCaller` needs a *resolved* context.
// The `await` makes it resolve at module load.

What if `createContext` is NOT async initially, but `createInnerTRPCContext` uses async `auth()`?
```typescript
// src/trpc/server.ts
import "server-only";
import { headers } from "next/headers";
import { appRouter } from "~/server/api/root";
import { createTRPCContext as actualCreateContextForRouteHandler } from "~/server/api/trpc"; // This is async
import { createInnerTRPCContext } from "~/server/api/trpc"; // This is sync, takes session
import { auth } from "~/server/auth"; // This is async

// This context creator is for Server Components.
// It will be called by the `createCaller`.
// It needs to be async to fetch the session.
const createServerComponentContext = async () => {
  const session = await auth(); // Gets session for the current request
  const heads = headers(); // Gets headers for the current request
  return createInnerTRPCContext({ // Call the synchronous inner context creator
    session,
    headers: heads,
  });
};

// Create the caller instance.
// IMPORTANT: This will be a single instance, but the context it uses
// must be created (or fetched from cache) per request.
// `appRouter.createCaller` takes the context object directly.
// So, we cannot export `api` as a pre-created caller if context is async.

// Solution: Export a function that creates the caller with fresh context.
// Or, use a Proxy to make it "look" like a pre-created caller.

// Approach 1: Export a function to get the caller (simple, explicit)
// export const getCaller = async () => {
//   const context = await createServerComponentContext();
//   return appRouter.createCaller(context);
// };
// Usage in SC: const caller = await getCaller(); const data = await caller.some.query();

// Approach 2: Proxy (more like create-t3-app's convenience `api` object)
// This is more advanced. Let's stick to what create-t3-app might provide for simplicity:
// `create-t3-app` often sets up `api` using `createTRPCProxyClient` for server components
// if it needs to make "actual" fetch requests, or it provides a way to pass
// a request-scoped context to `createCaller`.

// The key is `headers()` and `auth()` must be called within a request scope.
// If `createContext` is wrapped with `React.cache`, it runs once per request.
// The `await` must not be at the top level of the module.

// Revised src/trpc/server.ts (aligning with T3 style that uses React.cache effectively):
```
The `cache` function from `React` is designed for this. If `createContext` (which calls `headers()` and `auth()`) is wrapped in `cache`, then `cachedContext()` will execute `createContext` only once per request, and subsequent calls to `cachedContext()` within the same request lifecycle will return the memoized value.

So, `appRouter.createCaller(await cachedContext())` *would* work if `await cachedContext()` is evaluated when `api.someProcedure` is called, not when `api` is defined. This requires `api` to be a proxy.

Let's try the direct caller pattern using `React.cache` correctly, assuming `createCaller` can work with a promise that resolves to context or a cached context function.
The most straightforward pattern for `createCaller` usually involves passing the *actual context object*.
The `create-t3-app` often defines `api` in `src/trpc/server.ts` as:
```typescript
// From a typical T3 App Router scaffold
import { createTRPCContext } from "~/server/api/trpc"; // This is the async context creator now
import { appRouter } from "~/server/api/root";

export const api = appRouter.createCaller(await createTRPCContext({ // Problem: still await at top-level
    headers: new Headers() // Dummy headers, real ones should be used if context reads them.
                           // This is where the confusion lies.
}));
```
The issue is that `createTRPCContext` in `trpc.ts` *itself* calls `await auth()`.
If `createTRPCContext` from `trpc.ts` (the one for route handlers) is:
```typescript
export const createTRPCContext = async (opts: { req: NextRequest; }) => {
  const session = await auth();
  return createInnerTRPCContext({ session, headers: opts.req.headers });
};
```
This cannot be directly called at the top level of `server.ts` because it doesn't have `NextRequest`.

The `createContext` in `src/trpc/server.ts` (the one that uses `React.cache` and `next/headers`) is the correct one for the caller.

Let's refine `src/trpc/server.ts` to correctly use `createCaller`.
The error means `headers()` is called during module initialization.
The `api` object must be defined such that `createContext` is called *lazily* or *per request*.

```typescript
// src/trpc/server.ts
import "server-only";
import { headers }
  from "next/headers"; // This is okay to import at top-level
import { appRouter }
  from "~/server/api/root";
import { createInnerTRPCContext }
  from "~/server/api/trpc"; // The synchronous inner context creator
import { auth }
  from "~/server/auth"; // The async auth function
import { cache } from "react";

// This function creates the context for a specific request.
// It's async because `auth()` is async.
// It should be wrapped in `React.cache` to be memoized per request.
const createRequestContext = cache(async () => {
  const H = headers(); // `headers()` is called here, inside the cached function
  const session = await auth(); // `auth()` is called here
  return createInnerTRPCContext({
    session,
    headers: H,
  });
});

// Create the tRPC caller.
// THIS IS STILL PROBLEMATIC if `await createRequestContext()` is at the top level.
// export const api = appRouter.createCaller(await createRequestContext());

// The official T3 way (or one of them) involves a Proxy or a getter for the API.
// Let's try to ensure the context is resolved when a procedure is called.

// This is a common pattern seen in some T3 examples for server-side caller:
// We export a proxy or an object that initializes the caller lazily for each procedure call.
// However, `createCaller` expects the context object.

// A simpler, direct way for Server Components, if you create the caller inside the component:
// async function MyServerComponent() {
//   const context = await createRequestContext();
//   const caller = appRouter.createCaller(context);
//   const data = await caller.some.query();
//   // ...
// }
// But we want to export a reusable `api` object.

// The T3 app often sets up a server client using `experimental_createTRPCNextAppDirServer`
// or creates a proxy client.
// If we stick to `createCaller`:
// The key is the `await` keyword. `await createRequestContext()` resolves the promise at module load time.
// We need to pass the *promise* or a *function that returns the promise* to something,
// or structure it so the `await` happens inside the procedure call.

// Let's look at the `create-t3-app` generated server client. It is often:
// export const api = createTRPCProxyClient<AppRouter>({ links: [...] })
// This is NOT using `createCaller`. It makes an HTTP request.

// If we want to use `createCaller` (direct function calls, no HTTP overhead):
// The context needs to be dynamically resolved.
// The problem is that `appRouter.createCaller` itself is synchronous and takes a context object.
// It does not take a function that returns a context.

// This suggests the context itself MUST be available synchronously when `createCaller` is called,
// OR `createCaller` is called inside each server component/action after awaiting context.
// If `auth()` and `headers()` store their state in AsyncLocalStorage, then `createInnerTRPCContext`
// can be synchronous if it calls `auth()` and `headers()` internally and those functions
// correctly retrieve from AsyncLocalStorage.

The error `headers was called outside a request scope` means that `headers()` which relies on AsyncLocalStorage is not finding the store. This happens if it's called during module evaluation (e.g. at the top-level of a file that gets imported) rather than during request handling (e.g. inside a React Server Component's render, or inside a Route Handler function).

My previous `src/trpc/server.ts`:
```ts
const createContext = cache(async () => {
  const heads = new Headers(headers()); // ERROR HERE
  // ...
});
export const api = appRouter.createCaller(await createContext()); // Await at top level
```
The `headers()` call is inside `createContext`. `createContext` is `await`ed at the top level. This means `headers()` is called at module load time.

**Revised strategy for `src/trpc/server.ts`:**
The `api` export needs to be an object where each procedure, when called, *then* creates the context and calls the underlying tRPC procedure. This is effectively what `createTRPCProxyClient` does but for HTTP. For direct calls, it's more manual if we want a single `api` object.

A common way `create-t3-app` handles this for `createCaller` pattern now:
```typescript
// src/trpc/server.ts
import "server-only";

import { createTRPCProxyClient, loggerLink, TRPCClientError } from "@trpc/client";
import { callProcedure } from "@trpc/server";
import { observable } from "@trpc/server/observable";
import { type TRPCErrorResponse } from "@trpc/server/rpc";
import { headers } from "next/headers"; // This is fine to import
import { cache } from "react";

import { appRouter, type AppRouter } from "~/server/api/root";
import { createInnerTRPCContext } from "~/server/api/trpc";
import { auth } from "~/server/auth"; // Import the auth function
import { transformer } from "./shared"; // Assuming transformer is here

/**
 * This wraps the `createTRPCContext` helper and provides the required context for the tRPC API when
 * handling a tRPC call from a React Server Component.
 */
const createContext = cache(async () => { // Renamed to avoid conflict with trpc.ts one
  const heads = new Headers(headers()); // `headers()` is called here - this is the key part
  heads.set("x-trpc-source", "rsc");
  const session = await auth(); // `auth()` is called here

  return createInnerTRPCContext({
    session,
    headers: heads,
  });
});

export const api = createTRPCProxyClient<AppRouter>({
  transformer,
  links: [
    loggerLink({
      enabled: (op) =>
        process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" ||
        (op.direction === "down" && op.result instanceof Error),
    }),
    /**
     * Custom RSC link that lets us use an experimental server-side TRPC client.
     * This link simulates the HTTP layer but directly calls procedures.
     */
    () =>
      ({ op }) =>
        observable((observer) => {
          createContext() // Context is created here, when link is processed
            .then((ctx) => {
              return callProcedure({
                procedures: appRouter._def.procedures,
                path: op.path,
                rawInput: op.input,
                ctx,
                type: op.type,
              });
            })
            .then((data) => {
              observer.next({ result: { data } });
              observer.complete();
            })
            .catch((cause: TRPCErrorResponse) => {
              observer.error(TRPCClientError.from(cause));
            });
        }),
  ],
});
```
This uses `createTRPCProxyClient` with a custom link that calls `callProcedure` directly. The `createContext` (which calls `headers()` and `auth()`) is invoked *inside* the link processing, which happens per tRPC call initiated from a Server Component. This pattern is from recent T3 scaffolds.

I also need a `src/trpc/shared.ts` for the transformer.
```typescript
// src/trpc/shared.ts
import superjson from "superjson";

export const transformer = superjson;
```

This should fix the `headers()` call scope issue.
The Prisma `output` path was correctly fixed in the previous step.
The user did not provide `src/trpc/shared.ts`, so I need to generate it.
</think>

You've hit a subtle but important aspect of using server-only functions like `headers()` with tRPC in Next.js App Router Server Components! The error `Error: \`headers\` was called outside a request scope` means that `headers()` (and similarly `cookies()` or `auth()` from NextAuth.js v5 if it relies on these) was executed when the `src/trpc/server.ts` module was first loaded, rather than during an active request.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the tRPC context (which uses `headers()` and `auth()`) is created *lazily* or *per request* when an API call is made from a Server Component. The `create-t3-app` an Vercel team have converged on a pattern using `createTRPCProxyClient` with a custom link for this.

Let's implement the necessary changes:

---
**1. Create `src/trpc/shared.ts`**
This file is often used in T3 setups to share the transformer (like `superjson`) between the client and server tRPC configurations.

```ts
// src/trpc/shared.ts
import superjson from "superjson";

/**
 * Shared tRPC transformer.
 * Useful for ensuring client and server use the same data serialization.
 */
export const transformer = superjson;

// You can also define shared helper functions or constants related to tRPC here.
// For example, a function to construct the tRPC endpoint URL:
export function getBaseUrl() {
  if (typeof window !== "undefined") return ""; // browser should use relative url
  if (process.env.VERCEL_URL) return `https://${process.env.VERCEL_URL}`; // SSR should use vercel url
  return `http://localhost:${process.env.PORT ?? 3000}`; // dev SSR should use localhost
}
```

---
**2. Update `src/trpc/server.ts` (Server-side tRPC Caller for Server Components)**
This is the crucial fix. We'll use `createTRPCProxyClient` with a custom link that correctly creates context within the request scope.

```ts
// src/trpc/server.ts
import "server-only"; // Ensures this module is never bundled for the client

import {
  createTRPCProxyClient,

**3. Update `src/trpc/react.tsx` (Client-side tRPC Provider and Hooks)**
Ensure the `httpBatchLink` uses the `getBaseUrl` from `shared.ts` for consistency.

```tsx
// src/trpc/react.tsx
"use client"; 

import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { httpBatchLink, loggerLink, type TRPCLink } from "@trpc/client";
import { createTRPCReact } from "@trpc/react-query";
import { type ReactNode, useState } from "react";
import { type Observable, observable } from '@trpc/server/observable';
import { toast } from "react-hot-toast";

import { type AppRouter } from "~/server/api/root"; 
import { transformer, getBaseUrl } from "./shared"; // Import from shared.ts

export const api = createTRPCReact<AppRouter>();

const errorHandlingLink: TRPCLink<AppRouter> = () => {
  return ({ next, op }) => {
    return observable((observer) => {
      const unsubscribe = next(op).subscribe({
        next(value) { observer.next(value); },
        error(err) {
          observer.error(err);
          if (err.data?.code === 'UNAUTHORIZED' || err.data?.code === 'FORBIDDEN') {
            toast.error(err.message || "Access denied. Please try logging in.");
          } else if (err.data?.zodError) {

            let messages: string[] = [];
            for (const field in zodErrors) {

            }
            toast.error(`Input error: ${messages.join(', ')}`);
          } else {
            toast.error(err.message || "An unexpected error occurred.");
          }
        },
        complete() { observer.complete(); },
      });
      return unsubscribe;
    });

            refetchOnWindowFocus: true,
            retry: (failureCount, error: any) => {
              if (error.data?.code === 'UNAUTHORIZED' || error.data?.code === 'FORBIDDEN' || error.data?.code === 'NOT_FOUND') {
                return false;
              }
              return failureCount < 2;
            },
          },

  );

  const [trpcClient] = useState(() =>

          url: getBaseUrl() + "/api/trpc", // Use shared getBaseUrl
          headers() {
            const heads = new Map(passedHeaders); 
            heads.set("x-trpc-source", "react-client"); 
            
            const headerObject: Record<string, string> = {};
            heads.forEach((value, key) => {
              headerObject[key] = value;
            });
            return headerObject;
          },
        }),
      ],
    })

  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>

---
**Summary and Conclusion:**

1.  **`src/trpc/shared.ts` (New File):** Created to share the `superjson` transformer and `getBaseUrl` function between client and server tRPC setups.
2.  **`src/trpc/server.ts` (Updated):**
    *   Refactored to use `createTRPCProxyClient` with a custom link that calls `callProcedure`.
    *   The `createContext` function (renamed to `createServerContext` for clarity) is wrapped with `React.cache` and correctly calls `headers()` and `auth()` *inside* this cached, request-scoped function. This is invoked when a tRPC procedure is actually called via the proxy client, thus ensuring `headers()` and `auth()` are within a valid request scope.
3.  **`src/trpc/react.tsx` (Updated):**
    *   Modified to import `transformer` and `getBaseUrl` from the new `src/trpc/shared.ts` for consistency.

These changes implement a common and robust pattern for setting up tRPC in a Next.js App Router project, correctly handling server-only functions like `headers()` and `auth()`. After applying these updates:

1.  Create the new file `src/trpc/shared.ts`.
2.  Replace the contents of `src/trpc/server.ts` and `src/trpc/react.tsx` with the new versions.
3.  Run `npm run dev` again.

This should resolve the "`headers` was called outside a request scope" error. The application should now build and run, allowing you to proceed with implementing the logic within your components and tRPC procedures.
