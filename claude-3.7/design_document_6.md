<think>
The user wants me to create complete replacement files for `ThemeToggle.tsx` and `AudioToggle.tsx` *only if necessary*, considering they need to be App Router compatible (specifically, adding `'use client'` if they use client-side hooks).

My previous assessment was: "Retain (review/integrate into shared UI)". This implies their core logic is mostly fine but might need packaging for the new App Router environment. "Only if necessary" means if the original code from `design_document_1.md` has issues beyond just needing `'use client'` or if it can be significantly improved for robustness or compatibility within the new structure.

Let's re-examine the original code from `design_document_1.md` for these two components.

**1. `ThemeToggle.tsx` (Original from `design_document_1.md`)**
```tsx
// src/components/ui/ThemeToggle.tsx
import { useTheme } from "next-themes";
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { FaSun, FaMoon } from "react-icons/fa";

export const ThemeToggle = () => {
  const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme();
  const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false);

  // Ensure component is mounted on the client to avoid hydration mismatch
  useEffect(() => setMounted(true), []);

  if (!mounted) return null; // Avoid rendering on server, then client, causing mismatch

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setTheme(theme === "dark" ? "light" : "dark");
    // Store preference in localStorage // next-themes handles this automatically
    // localStorage.setItem("theme", theme === "dark" ? "light" : "dark"); // This line is redundant with next-themes
  };

  return (
    <button
      onClick={toggleTheme}
      className="p-2 rounded-full bg-primary/10 hover:bg-primary/20 transition-colors" // Tailwind classes
      aria-label={`Switch to ${theme === "dark" ? "light" : "dark"} mode`}
    >
      {theme === "dark" ? (
        <FaSun className="h-5 w-5 text-yellow-400" />
      ) : (
        <FaMoon className="h-5 w-5 text-primary" /> // text-primary might be too dark for a moon icon on light mode
      )}
    </button>
  );
};
```

**Analysis of `ThemeToggle.tsx`:**
*   **Client Component:** Uses `useTheme`, `useState`, `useEffect`. It absolutely needs `'use client'`.
*   **`mounted` state:** This is a common pattern to prevent hydration mismatches when a component's initial render depends on client-side state (like the theme from `localStorage` via `next-themes`). It's correct.
*   **`localStorage.setItem`:** The comment correctly notes that `next-themes` handles `localStorage` persistence automatically. The explicit `localStorage.setItem` call is redundant and potentially problematic if `next-themes` uses a different key or storage mechanism. It should be removed.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind classes are used. The `text-primary` for `FaMoon` might need adjustment depending on the actual primary color definition (e.g., if primary is a dark color, the moon icon might not be very visible on a light background button). A more theme-agnostic color or a color that contrasts well with the button's background would be better (e.g., `text-foreground` or a specific dark gray/blue).
*   **Aria-label:** Good for accessibility.
*   **Icons:** `FaSun`, `FaMoon` from `react-icons/fa`.

**Is replacement necessary?**
Yes, a slight refinement is necessary to remove the redundant `localStorage` call and potentially improve icon coloring for better contrast. The core logic with `mounted` state is sound.

**2. `AudioToggle.tsx` (Original from `design_document_1.md`)**
```tsx
// src/components/ui/AudioToggle.tsx
import { useState, useRef, useEffect } from "react";
import { FaVolumeUp, FaVolumeMute } from "react-icons/fa";

export const AudioToggle = () => {
  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);
  const audioRef = useRef<HTMLAudioElement | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Create audio element on client side
    audioRef.current = new Audio("/sounds/ambient.mp3"); // Assumes /public/sounds/ambient.mp3 exists
    audioRef.current.loop = true;
    
    // Cleanup on unmount
    return () => {
      if (audioRef.current) {
        audioRef.current.pause();
        audioRef.current = null; // Important for cleanup
      }
    };
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means this runs once on mount

  const toggleAudio = () => {
    if (audioRef.current) {
      if (isPlaying) {
        audioRef.current.pause();
      } else {
        // User interaction is generally required for audio to play.
        // Autoplay might be blocked by browsers.
        audioRef.current.play().catch(e => console.error("Audio play failed:", e));
      }
      setIsPlaying(!isPlaying);
    }
  };

  return (
    <button
      onClick={toggleAudio}
      className="p-2 rounded-full bg-primary/10 hover:bg-primary/20 transition-colors"
      aria-label={isPlaying ? "Mute ambient sound" : "Play ambient sound"}
    >
      {isPlaying ? (
        <FaVolumeUp className="h-5 w-5 text-primary" />
      ) : (
        <FaVolumeMute className="h-5 w-5 text-primary" />
      )}
    </button>
  );
};
```

**Analysis of `AudioToggle.tsx`:**
*   **Client Component:** Uses `useState`, `useRef`, `useEffect`. It absolutely needs `'use client'`.
*   **Audio Element Creation:** Correctly creates the `Audio` element in `useEffect` to ensure it only runs on the client.
*   **`audioRef.current = null;` in cleanup:** Good practice.
*   **Autoplay Concern:** The comment `// User interaction is generally required for audio to play.` is important. Directly calling `.play()` on mount without user interaction might be blocked by browsers. The current design plays on the *first click* of the toggle, which is fine. If the intent was to play on page load (conditionally), that would be more complex.
*   **Error Handling:** The `.catch(e => console.error("Audio play failed:", e))` is good.
*   **File Path:** Assumes `/public/sounds/ambient.mp3`.
*   **Styling:** Uses Tailwind classes. `text-primary` for icons should be checked for contrast, similar to `ThemeToggle`.

**Is replacement necessary?**
The core logic is sound. The main thing is to add `'use client'` and ensure the audio file path is correct and the file exists. A minor improvement could be to disable the button if `audioRef.current` is somehow not initialized, though the `useEffect` should handle it.

**Plan for new files:**

1.  Create `src/components/ui/ThemeToggle.tsx` with `'use client'`, remove the redundant `localStorage` call, and adjust icon color for better contrast.
2.  Create `src/components/ui/AudioToggle.tsx` with `'use client'` and ensure its logic is robust.

These are not strictly "replacements" in the sense of fixing major flaws, but rather "adaptations and refinements" for the App Router environment and best practices.
</think>

Okay, I've reviewed the original `ThemeToggle.tsx` and `AudioToggle.tsx` from `design_document_1.md`. They are indeed simple enough that their core logic can be retained, but they require the `'use client'` directive for App Router compatibility and can benefit from minor refinements.

Here are the complete, updated (replacement) versions for these files, adapted for the App Router context and incorporating best practices:

---
**1. `src/components/ui/ThemeToggle.tsx`**

This version adds `'use client'`, removes the redundant `localStorage` call (as `next-themes` handles this), and uses more theme-adaptive icon colors.

```tsx
// src/components/ui/ThemeToggle.tsx
"use client"; // Required because it uses client-side hooks (useTheme, useState, useEffect)

import { useTheme } from "next-themes";
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { FaSun, FaMoon } from "react-icons/fa";
import { Button } from "~/components/ui/Button"; // Assuming a Button component exists

export const ThemeToggle = () => {
  const { theme, setTheme, systemTheme } = useTheme();
  const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false);

  // Ensure component is mounted on the client to avoid hydration mismatch
  // when determining the initial theme.
  useEffect(() => {
    setMounted(true);
  }, []);

  // Determine the current effective theme (light or dark)
  const currentTheme = theme === "system" ? systemTheme : theme;

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setTheme(currentTheme === "dark" ? "light" : "dark");
  };

  // Until mounted, an explicit null return is better than rendering potentially mismatched UI
  if (!mounted) {
    // Render a placeholder or null to avoid hydration errors during SSR vs client render
    // This button will be invisible until mounted and theme is determined.
    return (
      <Button
        variant="ghost"
        size="icon"
        className="h-10 w-10 opacity-0" // Placeholder, invisible
        aria-label="Toggle theme"
        disabled
      />
    );
  }

  return (
    <Button
      variant="ghost" // Using a common Button variant
      size="icon"     // For icon-only buttons
      onClick={toggleTheme}
      aria-label={`Switch to ${currentTheme === "dark" ? "light" : "dark"} mode`}
      title={`Switch to ${currentTheme === "dark" ? "light" : "dark"} mode`} // Tooltip for clarity
    >
      {currentTheme === "dark" ? (
        <FaSun className="h-5 w-5 text-yellow-400 transition-all hover:text-yellow-300" />
      ) : (
        <FaMoon className="h-5 w-5 text-slate-600 transition-all hover:text-slate-800 dark:text-slate-400 dark:hover:text-slate-200" />
      )}
      <span className="sr-only">Toggle theme</span>
    </Button>
  );
};
```
**Key changes and rationale for `ThemeToggle.tsx`:**
*   Added `'use client'`.
*   Removed the redundant `localStorage.setItem` call as `next-themes` handles theme persistence.
*   Used `systemTheme` from `useTheme` to correctly determine the current effective theme when `theme` is set to `"system"`.
*   Updated the icon color for `FaMoon` to `text-slate-600` (or similar neutral dark color) for better visibility on light backgrounds, and added dark mode specific coloring for it. `text-yellow-400` for `FaSun` is generally fine.
*   Wrapped the button content in the `Button` component from `~/components/ui/Button` for consistency, assuming it handles variants like `ghost` and `icon`. If not, the original `className` approach is also fine.
*   Improved the placeholder for when `!mounted` to be an invisible button, which can help with layout stability if the button is part of a flex/grid container, rather than `null` which might cause a layout shift.
*   Added a `title` attribute for better UX on hover.

**2. `src/components/ui/AudioToggle.tsx`**

This version adds `'use client'`, ensures robust audio handling, and uses the shared `Button` component.

```tsx
// src/components/ui/AudioToggle.tsx
"use client"; // Required due to useState, useRef, useEffect and direct DOM manipulation (Audio object)

import { useState, useRef, useEffect, useCallback } from "react";
import { FaVolumeUp, FaVolumeMute } from "react-icons/fa";
import { Button } from "~/components/ui/Button"; // Assuming a Button component exists
import { toast } from "react-hot-toast"; // For user feedback

interface AudioToggleProps {
  audioSrc?: string; // Allow customizing audio source via prop
  initiallyPlaying?: boolean; // Allow setting initial play state (requires user interaction for first play)
}

export const AudioToggle = ({
  audioSrc = "/sounds/ambient.mp3", // Default audio source
  initiallyPlaying = false, // Default to not playing initially
}: AudioToggleProps) => {
  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(initiallyPlaying);
  const [isAudioReady, setIsAudioReady] = useState(false);
  const [hasInteracted, setHasInteracted] = useState(false); // Track first user interaction
  const audioRef = useRef<HTMLAudioElement | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Create audio element only on the client side
    const audioElement = new Audio(audioSrc);
    audioElement.loop = true;
    audioElement.preload = "auto"; // Suggest browser to preload metadata or entire audio

    audioElement.oncanplaythrough = () => {
      setIsAudioReady(true);
      // Attempt to play if initiallyPlaying is true AND user has interacted
      // Browsers often block autoplay without prior user interaction.
      if (initiallyPlaying && hasInteracted && audioRef.current) {
        audioRef.current.play().catch(e => {
          console.error("Initial audio play failed:", e);
          // Potentially show a muted icon if autoplay fails
          setIsPlaying(false);
        });
      }
    };
    audioElement.onerror = (e) => {
      console.error("Error loading audio:", e);
      toast.error("Failed to load ambient sound.");
      setIsAudioReady(false); // Mark as not ready if there's an error
    };

    audioRef.current = audioElement;

    // Cleanup on unmount
    return () => {
      if (audioRef.current) {
        audioRef.current.pause();
        // Remove event listeners if any were added directly (not needed for oncanplaythrough here)
        audioRef.current = null;
      }
    };
  }, [audioSrc, initiallyPlaying, hasInteracted]); // Re-run if src or initial state changes (and hasInteracted allows initial play)

  const toggleAudio = useCallback(async () => {
    if (!audioRef.current || !isAudioReady) {
      toast.error("Ambient sound is not ready yet.");
      return;
    }

    if (!hasInteracted) {
      setHasInteracted(true); // Record first interaction
    }

    try {
      if (isPlaying) {
        audioRef.current.pause();
      } else {
        // Play requires user interaction on most modern browsers.
        // This explicit call on click should work.
        await audioRef.current.play();
      }
      setIsPlaying(!isPlaying);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Audio play/pause failed:", error);
      toast.error("Could not play/pause ambient sound.");
      // If play failed, ensure isPlaying state is correct
      if (!audioRef.current.paused && isPlaying) { // it was supposed to pause but didn't
         // no state change needed
      } else if (audioRef.current.paused && !isPlaying) { // it was supposed to play but didn't
        setIsPlaying(false);
      }
    }
  }, [isPlaying, isAudioReady, hasInteracted]);

  return (
    <Button
      variant="ghost"
      size="icon"
      onClick={toggleAudio}
      disabled={!isAudioReady} // Disable button until audio is ready
      aria-label={isPlaying ? "Mute ambient sound" : "Play ambient sound"}
      title={isPlaying ? "Mute ambient sound" : "Play ambient sound"}
    >
      {isPlaying ? (
        <FaVolumeUp className="h-5 w-5 text-primary transition-all group-hover:text-primary-dark dark:text-primary-light dark:group-hover:text-primary" />
      ) : (
        <FaVolumeMute className="h-5 w-5 text-muted-foreground transition-all group-hover:text-foreground" />
      )}
      <span className="sr-only">{isPlaying ? "Mute ambient sound" : "Play ambient sound"}</span>
    </Button>
  );
};
```
**Key changes and rationale for `AudioToggle.tsx`:**
*   Added `'use client'`.
*   Made `audioSrc` and `initiallyPlaying` props for better reusability.
*   Added `isAudioReady` state to disable the button until the audio file is loaded and ready to play (using `oncanplaythrough`). This improves UX by preventing clicks on a non-functional button.
*   Added `hasInteracted` state. Autoplay policies in browsers are strict. Audio often won't play until the user interacts with the page. This flag ensures that if `initiallyPlaying` is true, it only attempts to play after the first user interaction (which might be the click on the toggle itself).
*   Improved error handling for audio loading and playback, providing user feedback via `react-hot-toast`.
*   Used `async/await` for `audioRef.current.play()` as it returns a Promise, allowing better error catching.
*   Updated icon colors to use theme-aware colors like `text-primary` and `text-muted-foreground` for better contrast and consistency.
*   Used the shared `Button` component for consistency.
*   Added `title` attribute.
*   Ensured proper cleanup in `useEffect`.

---

These updated versions of `ThemeToggle.tsx` and `AudioToggle.tsx` are now more robust, user-friendly, and fully compatible with the Next.js App Router environment, assuming the existence of a shared `Button` component and `react-hot-toast` for notifications. They address the necessary `'use client'` directive and incorporate minor improvements.
