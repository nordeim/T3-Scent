The user wants a complete and fully working version of `src/app/page.tsx`.
In the previous step, I provided a snippet showing the correction for the tRPC call:
`featuredProductsData = await serverApi.products.getAll.query({ ... });`

I need to take the full `src/app/page.tsx` that I generated before (which was based on `design_document_1.md`'s homepage and adapted for App Router with a client component for interactions) and ensure this correction is applied, and that all other aspects are consistent with our current state.

**Key elements of `src/app/page.tsx` from my previous version:**
*   It's a Server Component by default.
*   It fetches `featuredProducts` using `serverApi`.
*   It uses a client component `HomePageClientInteractions` for parts requiring client-side JavaScript (like parallax, video background opacity, AudioToggle).
*   It renders static sections directly (like "About Us" text).
*   It passes `featuredProducts` to `HomePageClientInteractions` if that component also needs to display them (or it could be passed to `ProductGrid` directly from the server component).
*   It has `generateMetadata` for SEO.

**Plan for `src/app/page.tsx`:**
1.  **Start with my previously generated App Router version of `src/app/page.tsx`.**
2.  **Correct the tRPC call:** Ensure `await serverApi.products.getAll.query({ ... })` is used.
3.  **Imports:** Verify all imports are correct for the App Router structure (e.g., `Link` from `next/link`, `Image` from `next/image`, `serverApi` from `~/trpc/server`).
4.  **Data Fetching:** Confirm data is fetched directly in the async Server Component.
5.  **Client Component Usage:** Ensure `HomePageClientInteractions` is correctly imported and used, and that props passed to it are appropriate. The static parts of the Hero section content that don't need client-side JS for their *rendering* can be passed as children.
6.  **Static Sections:** Render static sections like "About Us" text content directly. The *parallax effect on images within the About section* would need to be handled by `HomePageClientInteractions` or another dedicated client component if that effect relies on JavaScript scroll listeners. My previous version noted this complexity. For a "fully working version" now, I might simplify this by making the About section images static initially, or ensure `HomePageClientInteractions` is structured to handle those refs if it's passed the whole About section as a child.
7.  **`ProductGrid`:** Ensure `ProductGrid` is imported and used correctly with the fetched `featuredProducts`.
8.  **`generateMetadata`:** Review and ensure it's complete and uses `env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`.
9.  **Error Handling:** Basic try/catch for the data fetching.
10. **Structure:** Maintain clear separation between server-rendered static content and client-rendered interactive content.

Let's reconstruct it carefully. The `HomePageClientInteractions` component handles the dynamic Hero background and potentially other scroll-based effects. The `page.tsx` itself will be the entry point, fetching data and orchestrating the static and client parts.
</think>

You're right to ask for the complete file! Snippets can sometimes miss context. Here is the complete and updated version of `src/app/page.tsx`, incorporating the fix for the tRPC call and ensuring it aligns with the App Router structure and our previous discussions.

This version assumes:
*   `HomePageClientInteractions` will handle the interactive Hero section (video background, parallax on hero text, AudioToggle).
*   The "About Us" text is static, but the parallax effect on its images would need to be handled by `HomePageClientInteractions` or a separate client component if it requires JavaScript. For this version, I'm keeping the About section's *text* server-rendered and its *images* static to simplify; JavaScript-driven parallax for those images would be an enhancement within `HomePageClientInteractions` or a new client component.
*   `ProductGrid` is a component that takes products and renders them.
*   Other components like `TestimonialCarousel` and `NewsletterForm` are placeholders and would likely be client components.

**Key considerations in this full version:**
*   **`serverApi` Call:** The call to `serverApi.products.getAll.query` is now correct.
*   **`HomePageClientInteractions`:** This component is crucial for managing client-side effects for the hero section. The static text content of the hero is passed as `children` to it. The `AudioToggle` would be rendered within `HomePageClientInteractions`.
*   **Static vs. Client for "About Us" Images:** I've kept the images in the "About Us" section rendered statically for now. If JavaScript-driven parallax is desired for these specific images, that part of the "About Us" section would need to be extracted into its own client component or `HomePageClientInteractions` would need to be more complex to manage refs for elements rendered by its parent Server Component (which is possible but can get tricky). CSS parallax is an alternative if feasible.
*   **Image Paths:** Assumes images like `/images/about-1.jpg`, `/images/about-2.jpg`, `/images/og-default.jpg` exist in your `/public/images/` directory.
*   **Placeholder Components:** Comments indicate where components like `TestimonialCarousel` and `NewsletterForm` (which would be client components) would go.
*   **Styling:** Uses TailwindCSS classes consistent with a modern theme. `muted/30` and `primary/5` provide subtle background colors.
*   **SEO:** The `generateMetadata` function provides robust default SEO for the homepage.
*   **Error Handling for Data Fetching:** A `try...catch` block is used for fetching `featuredProducts` with a graceful fallback.

This version should be fully functional as the entry point for your homepage, correctly fetching data on the server and delegating client-side interactions appropriately. You'll need to implement the placeholder components (`Navbar`, `Footer`, `ProductGrid`, `Button`, `TestimonialCarousel`, `NewsletterForm`, etc.) and ensure `HomePageClientInteractions` correctly handles the hero section animations and `AudioToggle`.
