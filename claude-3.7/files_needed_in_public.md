**5. Note on Asset 404 Errors:**
The errors like `GET /sounds/ambient-nature.mp3 404` mean these files are missing from your `/public` directory.
*   **Action for you:**
    *   Create a `/public/sounds/` directory and place `ambient-nature.mp3` there.
    *   Create a `/public/images/` directory and place `about-1.jpg`, `about-2.jpg`, `hero-poster.jpg`, `og-default.jpg`, `twitter-default.jpg` there.
    *   Create a `/public/videos/` directory and place `hero-bg.mp4` there.
    *   Use appropriate placeholder images/sounds/videos if you don't have the final assets yet.

5.  **Asset 404s:** A reminder has been provided to place the necessary static assets in the `/public` directory.

**Regarding Asset 404 Errors:**
The errors like `GET /images/about-1.jpg 404` persist because these files are not present in your `/public/images/` (and similar for sounds/videos) directory.
*   **Action for you:** You need to create these directories (`public/images`, `public/sounds`, `public/videos`) and place the corresponding asset files there. I cannot create these assets for you. If you don't have them, use placeholders or remove the references for now.
