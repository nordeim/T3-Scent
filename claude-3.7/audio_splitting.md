Below are two common ways to split your downloaded audio file using ffmpeg on Ubuntu 24.04. In both examples, make sure you have ffmpeg installed:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

Assuming your file is named

```
"Soothing Relaxation： Relaxing Piano Music & Water Sounds for Sleep, Meditation, Spa & Yoga [77ZozI0rw7w].m4a"
```

### 1. Using the Segment Muxer

This method automatically splits the file into fixed-length segments without re-encoding (so it’s fast and lossless). For example, if you want segments of 30 seconds each, run:

```bash
ffmpeg -i "Soothing Relaxation： Relaxing Piano Music & Water Sounds for Sleep, Meditation, Spa & Yoga [77ZozI0rw7w].m4a" \
-f segment -segment_time 30 -reset_timestamps 1 -c copy out_%03d.m4a
```

**Explanation:**  
- **`-i "..."`** specifies the input file (quotes handle any spaces or special characters).  
- **`-f segment`** tells ffmpeg to use its segmenting feature.  
- **`-segment_time 30`** sets each segment’s duration to 30 seconds (adjust this as needed).  
- **`-reset_timestamps 1`** resets timestamps for each segment, which can help with playback.  
- **`-c copy`** copies the audio stream without re-encoding.  
- **`out_%03d.m4a`** names the output files sequentially (like out_000.m4a, out_001.m4a, etc.).

### 2. Manually Extracting Segments with -ss and -t

If you’d like more precise control—say, to extract specific parts—you can use the `-ss` (start time) and `-t` (duration) options. For example, to extract a 30‑second clip starting at 10:00 in the file:

```bash
ffmpeg -i "Soothing Relaxation： Relaxing Piano Music & Water Sounds for Sleep, Meditation, Spa & Yoga [77ZozI0rw7w].m4a" \
-ss 00:10:00 -t 00:00:30 -c copy segment1.m4a
```

Then, for the next segment starting at 10:30:

```bash
ffmpeg -i "Soothing Relaxation： Relaxing Piano Music & Water Sounds for Sleep, Meditation, Spa & Yoga [77ZozI0rw7w].m4a" \
-ss 00:10:30 -t 00:00:30 -c copy segment2.m4a
```

**Note:**  
- The `-ss` option specifies the start time.  
- The `-t` option specifies the duration of the output clip.  
- Using `-c copy` ensures that you’re not re-encoding (if frame accuracy is an issue, consider re-encoding by removing `-c copy`).

Both methods are effective, and your choice depends on whether you need automatic even splits (method 1) or precise control over each segment’s start and end (method 2). Feel free to adjust segment durations or file names as needed.

Converting an `.m4a` file to `.mp3` with `ffmpeg` is quite simple. Here’s a basic command:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.m4a output.mp3
```

This command tells ffmpeg to read `input.m4a` and convert it to `output.mp3`. By default, ffmpeg will use the `libmp3lame` encoder when outputting an MP3 file.

For better control over the quality of your output, you can use additional options. For example, to set the audio quality using the LAME quality scale (where lower values mean higher quality), you might use:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.m4a -codec:a libmp3lame -qscale:a 2 output.mp3
```

In this example:
- `-codec:a libmp3lame` explicitly specifies the MP3 encoder.
- `-qscale:a 2` sets the quality (with `2` being a very good balance between file size and quality).

Alternatively, if you prefer to set a specific bitrate, you can use:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.m4a -codec:a libmp3lame -b:a 192k output.mp3
```

Here, the `-b:a 192k` option sets the audio bitrate to 192 kbps.

These commands work on Ubuntu Linux 24.04 once ffmpeg is installed:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```
