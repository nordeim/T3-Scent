<think>
The user has provided new error logs. There are two main categories of issues again:

1.  **`Error: Route "..." used \`params.propertyName\` or \`searchParams.propertyName\`. \`params\` or \`searchParams\` should be awaited...`**
    *   This error is *still* present in `src/app/auth/signin/page.tsx`, `src/app/products/page.tsx`, and `src/app/collections/[slug]/page.tsx`.
    *   The previous fix (accessing props at the very beginning of the async Server Component function) did not resolve it.
    *   The user's log shows they ran `npm run dev` without the `--turbo` flag passed on the command line, but the script in `package.json` is still `"dev": "next dev --turbo"`. The Next.js startup log `â–² Next.js 15.3.2 (Turbopack)` confirms Turbopack is still active.
    *   **Crucial Next Step for User:** The user *must* modify their `package.json` script to `dev: "next dev"` to truly test without Turbopack. This is essential to isolate if this is a Turbopack-specific issue with dynamic prop handling.
    *   **Alternative Approach (if standard prop access consistently fails even with Webpack):** While not standard for props, this error message is so insistent on "awaiting" that it might hint at an internal Next.js mechanism where these props are not immediately "concrete" values in some scenarios (especially with very new Next.js versions). One *highly experimental* thing to try (if disabling Turbopack doesn't help) would be to see if explicitly resolving them through a no-op promise changes anything, though this is not a documented pattern for props.
        ```typescript
        // Example of a speculative workaround - NOT standard practice
        const safeSearchParams = await Promise.resolve(searchParams);
        const pageParam = safeSearchParams?.page;
        ```
        This is a long shot and likely not the correct idiomatic solution. The primary recommendation remains to test without Turbopack by editing `package.json`.
    *   For now, I will not change the code for `params`/`searchParams` access again, as the current pattern `const slug = params.slug;` *is* the documented standard. The focus must be on confirming the dev environment (Webpack vs. Turbopack).

2.  **`Module not found: Can't resolve '~/components/ui/Card'` (in `src/app/quiz/AdvancedScentQuizClient.tsx`)**
    *   **Log:** `Module not found: Can't resolve '~/components/ui/Card'`
    *   **Cause:** The `AdvancedScentQuizClient.tsx` component (which I provided in a more complete form earlier) imports `Card`, `CardContent`, `CardFooter`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardDescription` from `~/components/ui/Card`. This file/set of components was not created.
    *   **Fix:** Create `src/components/ui/Card.tsx` providing these common card components, styled with TailwindCSS, similar to Shadcn/ui components.

3.  **Client-side tRPC error (from first error block): `Error: [[ << query #1 ]quiz.getAdvancedQuizQuestions {}`**
    *   The full error message after this line was previously cut off. Now that the `params`/`searchParams` errors are occurring during the rendering of `/quiz`, it means the page itself is trying to render, and `AdvancedScentQuizClient` is likely being mounted and attempting to make its tRPC call.
    *   The "Module not found" for `Card` components would prevent `AdvancedScentQuizClient` from rendering correctly, which could lead to downstream issues or mask the true tRPC error.
    *   **Action:** Resolve the missing `Card` components first. If the tRPC error for `quiz.getAdvancedQuizQuestions` persists after that, we'd need to look at the full client-side error message and the server-side logs for that specific tRPC procedure call.

**Plan for this Iteration:**

1.  **Address Missing `Card` Components:**
    *   Create `src/components/ui/Card.tsx` that exports `Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardFooter`, `CardTitle`, `CardDescription`, and `CardContent` as styled React components.
2.  **Reiterate Turbopack Isolation:** Strongly advise the user to modify `package.json` to run `next dev` (without `--turbo`) to properly diagnose the `params`/`searchParams` issue.
3.  Provide the new `Card.tsx` file.
4.  No changes to the page files (`signin`, `products`, `collections/[slug]`) regarding `params`/`searchParams` access yet, pending the outcome of the Turbopack test. The existing code for accessing these props is standard.
5.  Asset 404s remain a user-actionable item (placing files in `/public`).

Let's create the `Card` components. These are standard in many UI libraries and are essential for structuring content.
</think>

You're doing a fantastic job isolating these issues! We're getting closer.

Let's address the new "Module not found" error and re-emphasize the `params`/`searchParams` issue.

**Issue 1: `Module not found: Can't resolve '~/components/ui/Card'`**

This error is occurring because your `src/app/quiz/AdvancedScentQuizClient.tsx` (and potentially other components) is trying to import various `Card` related components (`Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardFooter`, `CardTitle`, `CardDescription`, `CardContent`) from `~/components/ui/Card.tsx`, but this file doesn't exist yet.

**Solution:** We need to create this `Card.tsx` file with the necessary exports. These are common UI components, often styled similarly to what you'd find in libraries like Shadcn/ui.

---
**1. Create `src/components/ui/Card.tsx`**

```tsx
// src/components/ui/Card.tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { cn } from "~/lib/utils"; // Assuming your cn utility for class merging

const Card = React.forwardRef<
  HTMLDivElement,
  React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>
>(({ className, ...props }, ref) => (
  <div
    ref={ref}
    className={cn(
      "rounded-lg border border-border bg-card text-card-foreground shadow-sm",
      className
    )}
    {...props}
  />
));
Card.displayName = "Card";

const CardHeader = React.forwardRef<
  HTMLDivElement,
  React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>
>(({ className, ...props }, ref) => (
  <div
    ref={ref}
    className={cn("flex flex-col space-y-1.5 p-6", className)}
    {...props}
  />
));
CardHeader.displayName = "CardHeader";

const CardTitle = React.forwardRef<
  HTMLParagraphElement,
  React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLHeadingElement>
>(({ className, ...props }, ref) => (
  <h3
    ref={ref}
    className={cn(
      "text-2xl font-semibold leading-none tracking-tight",
      className
    )}
    {...props}
  />
));
CardTitle.displayName = "CardTitle";

const CardDescription = React.forwardRef<
  HTMLParagraphElement,
  React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLParagraphElement>
>(({ className, ...props }, ref) => (
  <p
    ref={ref}
    className={cn("text-sm text-muted-foreground", className)}
    {...props}
  />
));
CardDescription.displayName = "CardDescription";

const CardContent = React.forwardRef<
  HTMLDivElement,
  React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>
>(({ className, ...props }, ref) => (
  <div ref={ref} className={cn("p-6 pt-0", className)} {...props} />
));
CardContent.displayName = "CardContent";

const CardFooter = React.forwardRef<
  HTMLDivElement,
  React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>
>(({ className, ...props }, ref) => (
  <div
    ref={ref}
    className={cn("flex items-center p-6 pt-0", className)}
    {...props}
  />
));
CardFooter.displayName = "CardFooter";

export { Card, CardHeader, CardFooter, CardTitle, CardDescription, CardContent };
```
**Note on Styling:**
*   The `className` attributes use TailwindCSS utility classes and CSS variables that are typically defined when setting up a theme (e.g., with Shadcn/ui: `--border`, `--card`, `--card-foreground`, etc.).
*   Ensure your `src/styles/globals.css` has definitions for these CSS variables if you're not using a theme system that provides them. Example for `globals.css`:
    ```css
    /* src/styles/globals.css */
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;

    @layer base {
      :root {
        --background: 0 0% 100%; /* Light mode background */
        --foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%; /* Light mode text */
        /* ... other light mode variables ... */
        --card: 0 0% 100%;
        --card-foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
        --popover: 0 0% 100%;
        --popover-foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
        --primary: 195.0 72.2% 34.1%; /* #2a7c8a */
        --primary-foreground: 210 40% 98%;
        --secondary: 30.2 72.5% 65.7%; /* #e0a86f */
        --secondary-foreground: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;
        --muted: 210 40% 96.1%;
        --muted-foreground: 215.4 16.3% 46.9%;
        --accent: 13.6 100% 65.3%; /* #ff7b4f */
        --accent-foreground: 210 40% 98%;
        --destructive: 0 84.2% 60.2%;
        --destructive-foreground: 210 40% 98%;
        --border: 214.3 31.8% 91.4%;
        --input: 214.3 31.8% 91.4%;
        --ring: 195.0 72.2% 34.1%; /* Usually primary color */
        --radius: 0.5rem;
      }
      .dark {
        --background: 222.2 84% 4.9%; /* Dark mode background */
        --foreground: 210 40% 98%;   /* Dark mode text */
        /* ... other dark mode variables ... */
        --card: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
        --card-foreground: 210 40% 98%;
        --popover: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
        --popover-foreground: 210 40% 98%;
        --primary: 195.0 72.2% 34.1%; /* Keep or adjust for dark */
        --primary-foreground: 210 40% 98%;
        --secondary: 30.2 72.5% 65.7%;
        --secondary-foreground: 210 40% 98%; /* Adjust for dark */
        --muted: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;
        --muted-foreground: 215 20.2% 65.1%;
        --accent: 13.6 100% 65.3%;
        --accent-foreground: 210 40% 98%;
        --destructive: 0 62.8% 30.6%;
        --destructive-foreground: 210 40% 98%;
        --border: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;
        --input: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;
        --ring: 195.0 72.2% 34.1%;
      }
    }
    ```
    (You'd adjust these HSL values to match your theme colors from `tailwind.config.ts`).

**2. Addressing Persistent `params`/`searchParams` Errors**

The errors like `Error: Route "/products" used \`searchParams.page\`. \`searchParams\` should be awaited...` are still appearing even after you indicated running `next dev` (which should disable Turbopack if the `package.json` script was updated).

**Crucial Debugging Step (Reiteration):**
Please ensure your `package.json` script for `dev` is **exactly** `"dev": "next dev"`, with no `--turbo` flag.
```json
// package.json
"scripts": {
  // ...
  "dev": "next dev", // MUST NOT have --turbo for this test
  // ...
},
```
If, after confirming this and restarting your dev server, the `params`/`searchParams` errors still persist, this suggests a more subtle issue, potentially with:
*   **Next.js Version (`15.3.2`):** This is a very new (likely canary/beta) version. There might be undocumented changes or bugs related to how Server Component props are handled or how dynamic rendering context is managed. Downgrading to a more stable Next.js 14 version could be a temporary diagnostic step if this becomes a major blocker.
*   **tRPC Server Client Interaction:** The way `createServerActionClient` (which calls `auth()` and `headers()` internally via `createServerComponentContext`) is awaited at the beginning of your Server Component pages might be interacting with the availability of `params` and `searchParams` in an unexpected way in this specific Next.js version.

**Code to Keep for `params`/`searchParams` Access:**
For now, the way these props are accessed in the page files I provided is the standard, documented approach:
```typescript
// Example from src/app/products/page.tsx
export default async function ProductsPage({ params, searchParams }: ProductsPageProps) {
  // Access props at the beginning
  const pageParam = searchParams?.page;
  const sortByParam = searchParams?.sortBy;
  const categoryParam = searchParams?.category;

  const serverApi = await createServerActionClient(); // Then other async operations
  // ...
}
```
I will **not** change this access pattern yet, as it should be correct. The issue likely lies elsewhere if it persists after confirming Turbopack is truly disabled.

---
**3. Client-side tRPC Error: `<< query #1 ]quiz.getAdvancedQuizQuestions {}`**

The user's first error block shows this client-side tRPC logger output, but the *actual error message from tRPC* that would follow this line (e.g., "No procedure found", "Internal Server Error", Zod validation error, etc.) is not visible in the provided log snippet for *this specific prompt*.

However, now that `Card.tsx` will be created, `AdvancedScentQuizClient.tsx` will be able to render. If there's still an issue with the `quiz.getAdvancedQuizQuestions` call from the client:
*   **Check Server Logs:** When this client call is made, look at the terminal where `npm run dev` is running. The tRPC server-side logger (from `loggerLink` in `src/trpc/server.ts` or the default tRPC error formatting) should print any errors occurring within the `quizRouter.getAdvancedQuizQuestions` procedure. This will be key to diagnosing it.
*   **Verify Router Registration:** Double-check `src/server/api/root.ts` to ensure `quiz: quizRouter,` is correctly included.
*   **Verify Procedure Logic:** The `quizRouter.getAdvancedQuizQuestions` procedure I provided (with Zod parsing for options) should be robust. If it errors, the server log will tell us why (e.g., malformed JSON in the DB, database connection issue for that specific query).

---
**Summary and Conclusion:**

1.  **`src/components/ui/Card.tsx` (New File):** A complete set of Card components (`Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardDescription`, `CardContent`, `CardFooter`) has been provided. This should resolve the "Module not found" error for `~/components/ui/Card`. You may need to add the base CSS variables to your `globals.css` if you're not using a theming system like Shadcn/ui that provides them.
2.  **`params`/`searchParams` Error:**
    *   **Strongly advise ensuring Turbopack is disabled** by modifying the `dev` script in `package.json` to `"next dev"`.
    *   The current code for accessing these props in Server Components is standard. If the error persists with Webpack, it might indicate a deeper issue with the Next.js version or a subtle interaction with other dynamic APIs.
3.  **Client-side tRPC Quiz Error:**
    *   The "Module not found" for Card components was likely preventing the `AdvancedScentQuizClient` from rendering and making its tRPC call properly. With `Card.tsx` in place, this might resolve, or a new, more specific tRPC error might become visible on the client or server if the `quiz.getAdvancedQuizQuestions` procedure itself has issues (e.g., no data in DB, data transformation error).

**Next Steps for You:**
1.  Create the new file `src/components/ui/Card.tsx` with the provided content.
2.  Ensure your `src/styles/globals.css` has the necessary CSS variables for the Card component styling (or adapt the Card component's Tailwind classes to use your existing theme variables like `bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `border-border`).
3.  **Critically, modify your `package.json`'s `"dev"` script to be `"dev": "next dev",` to test without Turbopack.** Then stop and restart your dev server with `npm run dev`.
4.  Navigate to the pages that were erroring due to `params`/`searchParams` (`/auth/signin`, `/products`, `/collections/new-arrivals`) and observe if the error changes or is resolved.
5.  Navigate to `/quiz` and check your browser console and server terminal logs for any errors related to the `quiz.getAdvancedQuizQuestions` tRPC call.

This should help narrow down the persistent `params`/`searchParams` issue and allow the quiz page to attempt its data fetching.
