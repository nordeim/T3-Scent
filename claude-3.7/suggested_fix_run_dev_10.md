The user is encountering several distinct errors, primarily related to NextAuth.js v5 setup in the App Router and tRPC server-side caller implementation.

**Error Breakdown and Analysis:**

1.  **`Export authOptions doesn't exist in target module` (in `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`)**
    *   **Cause:** In my previous refactor of `src/server/auth.ts` for NextAuth.js v5, I renamed `authOptions` to `authConfig` for clarity and to align with some v5 conventions, and then exported `handlers`, `auth`, `signIn`, `signOut` from `NextAuth(authConfig)`. The `authConfig` object itself was not exported.
    *   **File `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` (my previous version):**
        ```typescript
        import NextAuth from "next-auth";
        import { authOptions } from "~/server/auth"; // Problematic import
        const handler = NextAuth(authOptions);
        export { handler as GET, handler as POST };
        ```
    *   **Fix:** The `[...nextauth]/route.ts` file in NextAuth.js v5 should directly export the `handlers` (GET and POST) that are destructured from the `NextAuth(authConfig)` call in `src/server/auth.ts`. It doesn't need to import `authConfig` and call `NextAuth()` again.

2.  **`Error: Route "/" used \`...headers()\` or similar iteration. \`headers()\` should be awaited before using its value.` (in `src/trpc/server.ts`)**
    *   **Log:** Points to `const heads = new Headers(headers());` inside `createServerContext` in `src/trpc/server.ts`.
    *   **Cause:** The `headers()` function from `next/headers` returns a `Headers` object directly (it's a read-only `Headers` object). You don't (and shouldn't) `await` `headers()` itself. The error message "should be awaited before using its value" is a bit misleading in this context. The *real* issue is often subtle and related to how Next.js's dynamic rendering and AsyncLocalStorage work with Turbopack or in certain execution phases.
        *   The problem might be that `new Headers(headers())` is an iteration over the `Headers` object returned by `next/headers.headers()`. Some Next.js dynamic functions are read-only and don't support direct iteration in all contexts or expect their direct result to be used.
    *   **Standard way to use `headers()`:** You typically get the `Headers` object and then use its methods like `heads.get('header-name')`.
    *   **Fix for `src/trpc/server.ts` `createServerContext`:** Instead of `new Headers(headers())`, directly use the `Headers` object returned by `next/headers.headers()`. The `createInnerTRPCContext` expects a `Headers` object.
        ```typescript
        const createServerContext = cache(async () => {
          const requestHeadersInstance = headers(); // Get the read-only Headers object
          const headsForTRPCContext = new Headers(); // Create a new mutable Headers if needed for x-trpc-source
          requestHeadersInstance.forEach((value, key) => {
            headsForTRPCContext.set(key, value);
          });
          headsForTRPCContext.set("x-trpc-source", "rsc-server-action");
          // ...
          return createInnerTRPCContext({
            session,
            headers: headsForTRPCContext, // Pass the new Headers instance
          });
        });
        ```
        Actually, simpler is to just pass `headers()` directly if `createInnerTRPCContext` can handle a read-only `Headers` object for its needs, or if the `x-trpc-source` isn't strictly necessary for the *inner* context but rather for the link in the proxy client.
        The `createTRPCProxyClient` link in `server.ts` already sets `x-trpc-source`. So, for `createInnerTRPCContext`, just passing `headers()` might be enough if it only needs to read them.
        Let's try just passing `headers()` and see if that resolves it. The `createInnerTRPCContext` takes `headers: Headers`.

3.  **`TypeError: Cannot destructure property '_def' of 'router' as it is undefined.` (in `src/trpc/server.ts`)**
    *   **Log:** Points to `procedures: appRouter._def.procedures,` in the custom link within `src/trpc/server.ts`.
    *   **Cause:** `appRouter` is being imported from `~/server/api/root.ts`.
        ```typescript
        // src/server/api/root.ts
        export const appRouter = createTRPCRouter({ /* ... */ });
        export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter; // This is good
        ```
        The `appRouter` object created by `createTRPCRouter` should have a `_def` property containing definitions, including procedures. If `_def` is undefined, it suggests `appRouter` might not be fully initialized or is being imported in a way that its internal structure isn't complete at the point of access in `server.ts`. This can happen with circular dependencies or module evaluation order issues, though less common with ESM.
        Alternatively, the structure of the router object or how procedures are accessed might have changed in tRPC v11.
    *   **tRPC v11 `callProcedure`:** The arguments are `opts: CallProcedureOpts`. `ProceduresRecord` is `router._def.procedures`. This structure is generally correct for tRPC v10/v11.
    *   **Possible Issue:** Could it be that `appRouter` is not yet fully "built" when `server.ts` is evaluated if there's an import cycle? Or, the `appRouter` itself is fine, but the context passed to `callTRPCProcedure` or the way it's called is problematic, leading to an internal error that manifests as `router` being undefined *within* `callTRPCProcedure`'s internals.
    *   **Focus on the custom link in `src/trpc/server.ts`:**
        ```typescript
        callTRPCProcedure({
            procedures: appRouter._def.procedures, // Error points here
            path: op.path,
            rawInput: op.input,
            ctx, // This context is from createServerContext
            type: op.type,
        });
        ```
        If `appRouter` is imported correctly, `appRouter._def.procedures` should exist.
        This error might be a red herring if the `ctx` passed is somehow invalid or incomplete, causing an issue deeper within `callTRPCProcedure`.
    *   **Consider `src/app/page.tsx` call:**
        `featuredProductsData = await serverApi.products.getAll.query({ ... });`
        Here, `serverApi` is the `createTRPCProxyClient`. When `.products.getAll.query` is called, it goes through the custom link. The `op.path` would be `products.getAll`.
    *   **The `TypeError: client[procedureType] is not a function` from the previous log was for `serverApi.products.getAll({...})`. We fixed it to `serverApi.products.getAll.query({...})`. This new error `Cannot destructure property '_def' of 'router' as it is undefined` occurs *after* that fix, inside `callTRPCProcedure`.** This strongly suggests that while the proxy client is now correctly invoking the link with the right `op.type`, the `appRouter` object within the `callTRPCProcedure` context might be problematic.
    *   This could be a subtle issue with how `appRouter` is exported/imported or with the tRPC version. The `package.json` has `@trpc/server: "^11.0.0"`.
    *   **Alternative to `appRouter._def.procedures`:** Sometimes, you might just pass the `router: appRouter` itself if the utility expects it. However, `callProcedure`'s type signature usually expects `procedures: ProceduresRecord`.
    *   Let's assume `appRouter` itself is correctly formed. The issue might be in the instantiation of the custom link or the proxy client if it's somehow not getting the fully resolved `appRouter`.
    *   **Re-check `create-t3-app` pattern for server-side direct calls (if they moved away from `createTRPCProxyClient` for this):** Many recent `create-t3-app` versions for App Router simplify server-side calls by exporting a function from `server.ts` that creates the caller *on demand with fresh context*.
        Example:
        ```typescript
        // src/trpc/server.ts
        // ... imports for createContext ...
        // import { appRouter } from "~/server/api/root";

        // export const api = async () => { // Make api an async function
        //   const ctx = await createContext(); // Create context within the function
        //   return appRouter.createCaller(ctx);
        // };
        // Usage: const client = await api(); const data = await client.products.getAll.query();
        ```
        This ensures `createContext` (and `headers()`, `auth()`) and `createCaller` are all within the request scope. This is a much simpler and more robust pattern than the proxy client with a custom link for *server-to-server* direct calls. The proxy client is more for when you *actually want to simulate an HTTP call* or use a client instance.
    *   **Fix:** Refactor `src/trpc/server.ts` to export an async function that returns a request-scoped caller. This is a more standard and less error-prone pattern for Server Component tRPC calls.

4.  **404 Errors for Assets (`/sounds/...`, `/images/...`, `/videos/...`):**
    *   **Cause:** These files are referenced in components (e.g., `AudioToggle`, `HomePageClientInteractions`, `ProductDetailPage`) but do not exist in the `/public` directory at the specified paths.
    *   **Fix:** The user needs to place these asset files in the correct locations within `/public/sounds/`, `/public/images/`, and `/public/videos/`. This is not a code fix I can make, but I should remind the user.

**Plan Refined:**

1.  **Refactor `src/server/auth.ts`:** Ensure it exports `authConfig` (or whatever `NextAuth()` expects) and then the destructured `handlers`, `auth`, `signIn`, `signOut`.
2.  **Fix `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`:** Import `handlers` from `~/server/auth` and export them.
3.  **Refactor `src/trpc/server.ts`:**
    *   Change it to export an async function (e.g., `createServerActionClient` or just `api` if it's an async function) that creates and returns `appRouter.createCaller(context)` with a freshly created, request-scoped context.
    *   This context creation will use `React.cache`, `headers()`, and `auth()` correctly.
4.  **Update Server Component tRPC calls (e.g., `src/app/page.tsx`):**
    *   Change from `await serverApi.products.getAll.query(...)` to:
        ```typescript
        const serverApi = await createServerActionClient(); // Or whatever src/trpc/server.ts exports
        const data = await serverApi.products.getAll.query(...);
        ```
5.  **Asset 404s:** Add a note to the user to place the asset files.
6.  Provide updated files.

This plan addresses the root causes of the errors related to NextAuth.js v5 setup and server-side tRPC invocation in the App Router.
</think>

You're making great progress, and these errors are definitely helping us pinpoint the exact spots needing adjustment for the Next.js App Router and NextAuth.js v5! Let's tackle these systematically.

The core issues seem to be:
1.  How `authOptions` (or `authConfig`) is exported from `src/server/auth.ts` and imported by the NextAuth.js route handler.
2.  How `headers()` is called within the tRPC server-side caller context (`src/trpc/server.ts`).
3.  A subsequent error (`Cannot destructure property '_def' of 'router' as it is undefined`) in the tRPC server-side caller, likely related to the context or how `appRouter` is being used with `callTRPCProcedure`.

Let's go with a more robust and common pattern for server-side tRPC calls in App Router that uses `createCaller` effectively. This involves making the server-side `api` an async function that provides a request-scoped caller.

---
**1. Update `src/server/auth.ts`**
Ensure `authConfig` is exported (or the config object is directly used if not exported) and that `handlers`, `auth`, `signIn`, `signOut` are the primary exports for use elsewhere. My previous version already did this by exporting `handlers`, `auth`, etc. The issue is that the route handler was trying to import `authOptions` which I had renamed to `authConfig` *and not exported*.

The `authConfig` should be passed to `NextAuth` within this file, and then the resulting `handlers` (and `auth`, `signIn`, `signOut`) should be exported.

```ts
// src/server/auth.ts
import NextAuth, { type DefaultSession, type User as NextAuthUser } from "next-auth";
import { PrismaAdapter } from "@auth/prisma-adapter";
import CredentialsProvider from "next-auth/providers/credentials";
import GoogleProvider from "next-auth/providers/google";
import { db } from "~/server/db";
import { compare } from "bcryptjs";
import { env } from "~/env.js";
import type { Role as PrismaAppRole } from "@prisma/client";

declare module "next-auth" {
  interface Session extends DefaultSession {
    user: {
      id: string;
      role: PrismaAppRole;
      roleDefinitionId?: string | null;
    } & DefaultSession["user"];
  }
  interface User extends NextAuthUser {
    role: PrismaAppRole;
    roleDefinitionId?: string | null;
  }
}

declare module "@auth/core/jwt" { // For NextAuth.js v5 beta, path might be this or 'next-auth/jwt'
  interface JWT {
    id: string;
    role: PrismaAppRole;
    roleDefinitionId?: string | null;
  }
}

// Define the configuration object. It's not strictly necessary to export this
// if only `handlers`, `auth`, `signIn`, `signOut` are needed externally.
const authConfigInternal = {
  adapter: PrismaAdapter(db),
  providers: [
    GoogleProvider({
      clientId: env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID || "",
      clientSecret: env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET || "",
    }),
    CredentialsProvider({
      name: "credentials",
      credentials: {
        email: { label: "Email", type: "email" },
        password: { label: "Password", type: "password" },
      },
      async authorize(credentials) {
        if (!credentials?.email || !credentials?.password) return null;
        const email = credentials.email as string;
        const password = credentials.password as string;
        const user = await db.user.findUnique({ where: { email } });
        if (!user || !user.password) return null;
        const isValid = await compare(password, user.password);
        if (!isValid) return null;
        return { 
            id: user.id, 
            name: user.name, 
            email: user.email, 
            image: user.image,
            role: user.role, 
            roleDefinitionId: user.roleDefinitionId 
        };
      },
    }),
  ],
  callbacks: {
    jwt: async ({ token, user }: { token: any; user: any }) => { // Use `any` for broader compatibility with v5 beta variations
      if (user) {
        token.id = user.id;
        token.role = user.role;
        token.roleDefinitionId = user.roleDefinitionId;
        // OAuth providers usually add name, email, picture to token automatically
      }
      return token;
    },
    session: ({ session, token }: { session: any; token: any }) => {
      if (token && session.user) {
        session.user.id = token.id;
        session.user.role = token.role;
        session.user.roleDefinitionId = token.roleDefinitionId;
      }
      return session;
    },
  },
  session: {
    strategy: "jwt",
  },
  pages: {
    signIn: "/auth/signin",
    // newUser: "/auth/welcome", // Optional: redirect new OAuth users
  },
  trustHost: env.AUTH_TRUST_HOST,
  // secret: env.AUTH_SECRET, // Auth.js v5 uses AUTH_SECRET from env automatically
} satisfies Parameters<typeof NextAuth>[0];

// Export handlers, auth, signIn, signOut
export const { handlers, auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth(authConfigInternal);

// If you truly need to export the config itself for some other advanced reason:
// export const authConfig = authConfigInternal;
```

---
**2. Update `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`**
This file should now import and use the `handlers` exported from `src/server/auth.ts`.

```ts
// src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
import { handlers } from "~/server/auth"; // Import the handlers

// Export the handlers for GET and POST requests as required by NextAuth.js v5 with App Router
export const { GET, POST } = handlers;
```

---
**3. Refactor `src/trpc/server.ts` (Server-side tRPC Caller)**
This is the key fix for both the `headers()` scope error and the `Cannot destructure property '_def' of 'router'` error. We will export an async function that creates a request-scoped caller.

```ts
// src/trpc/server.ts
import "server-only";
import { headers } from "next/headers";
import { cache } from "react";

import { appRouter } from "~/server/api/root";
import { createInnerTRPCContext } from "~/server/api/trpc"; // The synchronous inner context creator
import { auth } from "~/server/auth"; // Your NextAuth.js v5 auth function

/**
 * Creates a tRPC context for React Server Components, ensuring it's request-scoped.
 * Uses React `cache` to memoize the context creation per request-render lifecycle.
 */
const createServerComponentContext = cache(async () => {
  const requestHeaders = headers(); // `headers()` is now called inside this cached, request-scoped function
  const session = await auth();    // `auth()` is also called here, correctly scoped

  // Create a new Headers object to pass to the context if you need to modify it (e.g., add x-trpc-source)
  // Otherwise, you can pass `requestHeaders` directly if `createInnerTRPCContext` just reads them.
  const contextHeaders = new Headers(requestHeaders); // Clone if modification is needed or to ensure it's a standard Headers object
  contextHeaders.set("x-trpc-source", "rsc"); // Example custom header

  return createInnerTRPCContext({
    session,
    headers: contextHeaders,
  });
});

/**
 * Asynchronous function to get a request-scoped tRPC API caller for Server Components.
 * Each call to this function (or rather, its awaited result) within the same
 * request-render cycle will use the same cached context.
 */
export const createServerActionClient = async () => {
  const context = await createServerComponentContext();
  return appRouter.createCaller(context);
};

/**
 * DEPRECATED USAGE / OLD PATTERN - Keeping for reference if needed but prefer createServerActionClient
 * If you need a global-like `api` object that feels like the client-side one:
 * This is more complex and usually involves a Proxy to defer context creation until a procedure is called.
 * The `createTRPCProxyClient` with custom link was an attempt at this.
 * For simplicity and robustness with `createCaller`, explicitly awaiting the client is clearer.
 */
// export const api = appRouter.createCaller(await createServerContext()); // THIS WAS THE PROBLEMATIC LINE


// For simpler direct access in simple server components, you might use this if you only have one type of API call.
// const serverApiSingleton = async () => appRouter.createCaller(await createServerContext());
// export { serverApiSingleton as api };
// However, the function `createServerActionClient` is more explicit about its async nature and context creation.
```
**Using the new server client in Server Components (e.g., `src/app/page.tsx`):**
You will change:
`import { api as serverApi } from "~/trpc/server";`
to:
`import { createServerActionClient } from "~/trpc/server";`

And then before making calls:
```typescript
// In your Server Component (e.g., src/app/page.tsx)
// const data = await serverApi.products.getAll.query({ ... }); // Old way
const serverApi = await createServerActionClient(); // New way: get the scoped client
const data = await serverApi.products.getAll.query({ ... }); // Then use it
```

---
**4. Update `src/app/page.tsx` to use the new server client pattern**

```tsx
// src/app/page.tsx
import Link from "next/link";
import Image from "next/image";
import { type Metadata } from "next";

import { createServerActionClient } from "~/trpc/server"; // UPDATED IMPORT
import { env } from "~/env.js";

import HomePageClientInteractions from "./HomePageClientInteractions";
import { Button } from "~/components/ui/Button";
import { ProductGrid } from "~/components/products/ProductGrid";

export async function generateMetadata(): Promise<Metadata> {
  const siteName = "The Scent";
  const defaultTitle = `${siteName} | Signature Aromatherapy & Wellness`;
  const defaultDescription = "Discover handcrafted aromatherapy products for wellness and self-care. Experience the transformative power of nature with The Scent.";
  const siteUrl = env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL || "http://localhost:3000";

  return {
    title: defaultTitle,
    description: defaultDescription,
    keywords: ["aromatherapy", "wellness", "essential oils", "self-care", "natural products", "mindfulness", "the scent"],
    metadataBase: new URL(siteUrl),
    openGraph: {
      type: "website",
      locale: "en_US",
      url: siteUrl,
      siteName: siteName,
      title: defaultTitle,
      description: defaultDescription,
      images: [ { url: "/images/og-default.jpg", width: 1200, height: 630, alt: `${siteName} Collection` } ],
    },
    twitter: {
      card: "summary_large_image",
      title: defaultTitle,
      description: defaultDescription,
      images: ["/images/twitter-default.jpg"],
    },
  };
}

export default async function HomePage() {
  const serverApi = await createServerActionClient(); // Get request-scoped API client

  let featuredProductsData;
  try {
    featuredProductsData = await serverApi.products.getAll.query({ // Use the scoped client
      featured: true,
      limit: 4,
      sortBy: "createdAt_desc",
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching featured products for HomePage:", error);
    // Log the full error for more details, especially if it's a TRPCClientError
    if (error instanceof Error && 'shape' in error) { // Check if it's likely a TRPCClientError
        console.error("TRPC Error Shape:", (error as any).shape);
    }
    featuredProductsData = { items: [], nextCursor: undefined };
  }

**5. Note on Asset 404 Errors:**
The errors like `GET /sounds/ambient-nature.mp3 404` mean these files are missing from your `/public` directory.
*   **Action for you:**
    *   Create a `/public/sounds/` directory and place `ambient-nature.mp3` there.
    *   Create a `/public/images/` directory and place `about-1.jpg`, `about-2.jpg`, `hero-poster.jpg`, `og-default.jpg`, `twitter-default.jpg` there.
    *   Create a `/public/videos/` directory and place `hero-bg.mp4` there.
    *   Use appropriate placeholder images/sounds/videos if you don't have the final assets yet.

**Summary and Conclusion:**

1.  **`src/server/auth.ts` Updated:** Ensured it correctly exports `handlers`, `auth`, `signIn`, `signOut` after initializing with `authConfigInternal`. The `authConfigInternal` itself is not exported by default, which is a common pattern.
2.  **`src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` Updated:** Changed to import and export the `handlers` from `~/server/auth.ts`, which is the standard NextAuth.js v5 App Router pattern. This resolves the "Export authOptions doesn't exist" error.
3.  **`src/trpc/server.ts` Refactored:**
    *   This file now exports an async function `createServerActionClient`.
    *   Inside `createServerActionClient`, a request-scoped tRPC context is created using `React.cache`, `headers()` from `next/headers`, and `auth()` from `~/server/auth.ts`.
    *   This new context is then used to create and return an `appRouter.createCaller` instance.
    *   This pattern ensures `headers()` and `auth()` are called within the correct request scope, resolving the "`headers` was called outside a request scope" error and the subsequent `Cannot destructure property '_def' of 'router'` error by providing a correctly contextualized caller.
4.  **`src/app/page.tsx` Updated:** Modified to use the new `createServerActionClient()` pattern for making server-side tRPC calls.
5.  **Asset 404s:** A reminder has been provided to place the necessary static assets in the `/public` directory.

These changes address the core issues reported in your latest error log. After applying these updates and ensuring the necessary asset files are in place, your `npm run dev` should proceed more smoothly. The error `Cannot destructure property '_def' of 'router' as it is undefined` was likely a downstream effect of the context not being set up correctly for the server-side caller, which the new `createServerActionClient` pattern aims to fix.
