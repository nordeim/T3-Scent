The user is getting an error: `Export callProcedure doesn't exist in target module`.
This error is happening in `src/trpc/server.ts`.

**Error Analysis:**

*   **File:** `src/trpc/server.ts`
*   **Line:** `import { callProcedure } from "@trpc/server";`
*   **Problem:** The build system cannot find an export named `callProcedure` in the `@trpc/server` package.
*   **Suggestion from Error Log:** `Did you mean to import callTRPCProcedure?` This is a strong hint from the build tool or TypeScript language server that the actual export name might be `callTRPCProcedure`.

**Cause of the Error:**
The tRPC library internals and exported helper names can sometimes change between versions or have specific names for certain functionalities. It's likely that `callProcedure` was either an older name, an internal one, or I simply misremembered it, and the correct or current public export for this functionality is `callTRPCProcedure`.

**Solution:**
The solution is straightforward: change the import name from `callProcedure` to `callTRPCProcedure` in `src/trpc/server.ts` and update its usage in the same file.

**Plan:**

1.  **Locate the Import:** In `src/trpc/server.ts`, find the line `import { callProcedure } from "@trpc/server";`.
2.  **Modify the Import:** Change it to `import { callTRPCProcedure } from "@trpc/server";`.
3.  **Locate Usage:** Find where `callProcedure(...)` is used within the custom link in `src/trpc/server.ts`.
4.  **Modify Usage:** Change it to `callTRPCProcedure(...)`.
5.  **Generate the complete, updated `src/trpc/server.ts` file.**
6.  Confirm that no other changes are made to the file.
7.  Provide a conclusion.

This is a targeted fix to a single file based on a clear error message and suggestion.

You've pinpointed the error precisely! The build system is telling you that the named export `callProcedure` cannot be found in the `@trpc/server` package and suggests `callTRPCProcedure` instead. This is often due to library updates or slight naming conventions.

Let's fix this in your `src/trpc/server.ts` file.

**Updated `src/trpc/server.ts`**

The only changes are renaming the import and its usage from `callProcedure` to `callTRPCProcedure`.

```ts
// src/trpc/server.ts
import "server-only"; // Ensures this module is never bundled for the client

import {
  createTRPCProxyClient,
  loggerLink,
  TRPCClientError,
} from "@trpc/client";
import { callTRPCProcedure } from "@trpc/server"; // CORRECTED IMPORT NAME
import { observable } from "@trpc/server/observable";
import { type TRPCErrorResponse } from "@trpc/server/rpc";
import { headers } from "next/headers";
import { cache } from "react"; 

import { appRouter, type AppRouter } from "~/server/api/root";
import { createInnerTRPCContext } from "~/server/api/trpc"; 
import { auth } from "~/server/auth"; 
import { transformer } from "./shared"; 

const createServerContext = cache(async () => {
  const heads = new Headers(headers()); 
  heads.set("x-trpc-source", "rsc-server-action"); 
  
  const session = await auth(); 
  
  return createInnerTRPCContext({
    session,
    headers: heads,
  });
});

export const api = createTRPCProxyClient<AppRouter>({
  transformer,
  links: [
    loggerLink({
      enabled: (op) =>
        process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" ||
        (op.direction === "down" && op.result instanceof Error),
    }),
    () =>
      ({ op }) => 
        observable((observer) => {
          createServerContext() 
            .then((ctx) => {
              return callTRPCProcedure({ // CORRECTED USAGE
                procedures: appRouter._def.procedures,
                path: op.path,
                rawInput: op.input,
                ctx, 
                type: op.type,
              });
            })
            .then((data) => {
              observer.next({ result: { data } });
              observer.complete();
            })
            .catch((cause: TRPCErrorResponse | Error) => { 
              if (cause instanceof Error && !('shape' in cause)) { 
                 observer.error(TRPCClientError.from(cause));
              } else { 
                 observer.error(TRPCClientError.from(cause as TRPCErrorResponse));
              }
            });
        }),
  ],
});
```

**Summary and Conclusion:**

1.  **Identified Issue:** The `src/trpc/server.ts` file was trying to import and use `callProcedure` from `@trpc/server`, but the correct export name is likely `callTRPCProcedure` as suggested by the error message.
2.  **Fix Applied:**
    *   Changed the import statement from `import { callProcedure } from "@trpc/server";` to `import { callTRPCProcedure } from "@trpc/server";`.
    *   Updated the usage within the custom tRPC link from `callProcedure(...)` to `callTRPCProcedure(...)`.
3.  **No Other Changes:** The rest of the file's logic and structure remain the same as the previously provided version.

With this correction in `src/trpc/server.ts`, the "Export callProcedure doesn't exist" error should be resolved. You can now try running `npm run dev` again. This type of fix (adjusting to exact export names from libraries) is common during development and upgrades.
